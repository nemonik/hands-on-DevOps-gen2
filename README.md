# 1. Preface

This is the second edition of my hands-on DevOps course building upon [nemonik/hands-on-DevOps](https://github.com/nemonik/hands-on-DevOps).

The content of this course is actively under development whereas the prior is not.

This newest version of my Hands-on DevOps class is a re-platforming of sorts -- A sort of rewrite if you will. The prior version relied on multiple Vagrants (i.e., virtual machines) and was a beast to maintain. Several Vagrants were created through automation to run a multi-node [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/what-is-kubernetes/) cluster as well asa development VM. The approach modeled how I pre-flighted my work on my laptop vice using [minikube](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube). The [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/what-is-kubernetes/) cluster my class used made use of was [k3s](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s) and as it matured [k3d](https://github.com/rancher/k3d/) was introduced. [K3d](https://github.com/rancher/k3d/) is a lightweight wrapper to run [k3s](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s) in [Docker](https://docker.io) and provides a rather elegant solution to create and manage a single or multi-node [k3s](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s) cluster for development vice standing up multi-VMs and the burden they impose on the host (in my case my laptop). Around this same time I was considering using [k3d](https://github.com/rancher/k3d/) I also gave [Docker Desktop's](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) means of providing a [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/what-is-kubernetes/) cluster a try but I found it lacking, so I stuck with [k3d](https://github.com/rancher/k3d/). Around this same time I also moved fully off my MacBook for personal development moving to [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/) where I used [Docker](https://docker.io). This new version of my class infrastructure-as-code automation focuses instead of directly configuring the host or if need be a single Vagrant for the purpose of development.

# 2. DevOps

A hands-on DevOps course covering the culture, methods and repeated practices of modern software development involving Vagrant, VirtualBox, [Ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible), [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/what-is-kubernetes/), [k3s](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s), [k3d](https://github.com/rancher/k3d/), [Traefik](https://github.com/traefik/traefik), [Docker](https://docker.io), [Taiga](https://www.taiga.io/), [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/rluna-gitlab/gitlab-ce), [Drone CI](https://github.com/drone/drone), [SonarQube](https://github.com/SonarSource/sonarqube/), [Selenium](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium), [InSpec](https://github.com/inspec/inspec), [Heimdall 2](https://github.com/mitre/heimdall2), [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/)...

A reveal.js presentation written to accompany this course can found at [https://nemonik.github.io/hands-on-DevOps/](https://nemonik.github.io/hands-on-DevOps/).

This course will

1. Discuss DevOps,
2. Have you spin up a DevOps toolchain and development environment, and then
3. Author two applications and their accompanying pipelines, the first a continuous integration (CI) and the second a continuous delivery (CD) pipeline.

After this course, you will

1. Be able to describe and have hands-on experience DevOps methods and repeated practices (e.g., use of Agile methods, configuration management, build automation, test automation and deployment automation orchestrated under a CICD orchestrator), and why it matters;
2. Address challenges transitioning to DevOps methods and repeated practices;
3. Have had hands-on experience infrastructure-as-code to provision and configure an entire DevOps Factory (i.e. a toolchain and development environment) including Docker Registry, a [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/what-is-kubernetes/) cluster, [Taiga](https://www.taiga.io/), [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/rluna-gitlab/gitlab-ce), [Drone CI](https://github.com/drone/drone), [SonarQube](https://github.com/SonarSource/sonarqube/), [Heimdall 2](https://github.com/mitre/heimdall2);
4. Have had hands-on experience authoring code to include authoring and running automated tests in a CICD pipeline all under Configuration Management to ensure an application follows style, adheres to good coding practices, builds, identify security issues, and functions as expected;
5. Have had hands-on experience with
   1. using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) in Vagrant and [Ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible);
   2. creating and using Kanban board in [Taiga](https://www.taiga.io/);
   3. code configuration in git and [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/rluna-gitlab/gitlab-ce);
   4. authoring code in Go;
   5. using style checkers and linters;
   6. authoring a [Makefile](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)#Makefile>);
   7. various commands in [Docker](https://docker.io) (e.g., building a container image, pushing a container into a registry, creating and running a container);
   8. authoring a pipeline for [Drone CI](https://github.com/drone/drone);
   9. using Sonar Scanner CLI to perform static analysis;
   10. authoring security test in [InSpec](https://github.com/inspec/inspec);
   11. author an automated functional test in [Selenium](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium);
   12. authoring a dynamic security test in OWASP Zap; and
   13. using container platform to author and scale services;
6. Have had hands-on experience authoring code to include authoring and running automated tests in a CICD pipeline all under Configuration Management to ensure an application follows style, adheres to good coding practices, builds, identify security issues, and functions as expected.

We will be spending most of the course hands-on working with the tools and in the [Unix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix) command line making methods and repeated practices of DevOps happen, so as to grow an understanding of how DevOps actually works. Although, not necessary I would encourage you to pick up a free PDF of [The Linux Command Line by William Shotts](http://linuxcommand.org/tlcl.php) if you are no familiar wit the Linux command line.

Don't fixate on the tools used, nor the apps we develop in the course of learning how and why. How and why is far more important. This course like DevOps is not about tools although we'll be using them. You'll spend far more time writing code. (Or at the very least cutting-and-pasting code.)

# 5. What you should bring

The following skills would be useful in following along but aren't strictly necessary.

What you should bring:

- Managing Linux or Unix-like systems would be tremendously helpful, but not necessary, as we will be living largely within the terminal.
- A basic understanding of Vagrant, [Docker](https://docker.io), and [Ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible) would also be helpful, but not necessary.

# 7. DevOps unpacked

## 7.1. What is DevOps?

DevOps (a clipped compound of the words _development_ and _operations_) is a software development methodology with an emphasis on a reliable release pipeline, automation, and stronger collaboration across all stakeholders with the goal of delivery of value in close alignment with business objectives into the hands of users (i.e., production) more efficiently and effectively.

_Ops_ in DevOps gathers up every IT operation stakeholders (i.e., cybersecurity, testing, DB admin, infrastructure and operations practitioners -- essentially, any stakeholder not commonly thought of as directly part of the development team in the system development life cycle).

Yeah, that's the formal definition.

In the opening sentences of _Security Engineering: : A Guide to Building Dependable Distributed Systems — Third Edition_, author Ross Anderson defines what a security engineer is

> Security engineering is about building systems to remain dependable in the face of malice, error, or mischance. As a discipline, it focuses on the tools, processes, and methods needed to design, implement, and test complete systems, and to adapt existing systems as their environment evolve.

The words _security engineering_ could be replaced in the opening sentence with each one of the various stakeholders (e.g., development, quality assurance, technology operations).

The point I'm after is everyone is in it to collectively deliver dependable software.

Also, there is no need to overload the _DevOps_ term -- To _Dev wildcard (i.e., \*) Ops_ to include your pet interest(s), such as, _security_, _test_, _whatever_... to form _DevSecOps_, _DevTestOps_, _DevWhateverOps_... _DevOps_ has you covered.

## 7.2. What DevOps is not

About the tools or deploying faster.

![My Pillow Guy](./images/my_pillow_guy.png)

<sub>There are countless vendors out there, who want to sell you their crummy tool.</sub>

## 7.3. The tool exist to

Facilitate collaboration between the stakeholders.

## 7.4. To succeed at DevOps you must

**Combine software development and information technology operations in the systems development life cycle** with **a focus on collaboration across the life cycle to deliver features, fixes, and updates frequently in close alignment with business objectives**.

If the effort cannot combine both Dev and Ops in collaboration with this focus the effort will most certainly fail.

## 7.5. If your effort doesn't

**grok (i.e, Understand intuitively) what DevOps is in practice** and have performed the **necessary analysis of the existing culture and a strategy for how to affect a change** the effort again will likely fail.

I say this because the culture is the largest influencer over the success of both Agile and DevOps and ultimately the path taken (i.e., plans made.)

## 7.6. Conway's Law states

> Any organization that designs a system (defined broadly) will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization's communication structure.

From ["How Do Committees Invent?"](http://www.melconway.com/Home/Conways_Law.html)

Followed with

> Ways must be found to reward design managers for keeping their organizations lean and flexible.

This was written over 50 years ago.

If your communication structure is broke, so shall your systems be.

## 7.7. DevOps is really about

Providing the culture, methods and repeated practices to permit stakeholders to collaborate.

## 7.8. What is DevOps culture?

> **culture** noun \ _ˈkəl-chər_ \
> the set of shared attitudes, values, goals, and practices that characterizes an institution or organization

I love when a word means precisely what you need it to mean.

With the stakeholders sharing the same attitudes, values, goals, using the same tools, methods and repeated practices for their particular discipline you have **_DevOps Culture_**.

### 7.8.1. We were taught the requisite skills as children

![Paw Patrol](./images/paw_patrol.png)

### 7.8.2. Maintaining relationships is your most important skill

![Maintaining Relationships](./images/maintaining_relationships.png)

### 7.8.3. Be quick... Be slow to...

![Quick to slow](./images/quick_to_slow_to.png)

### 7.8.4. The pressures of social media

![Social Media](./images/social_media.png)

## 7.9. How is DevOps related to the Agile?

Agile Software Development is an umbrella term for a set of methods and practices based on the [values](http://www.agilealliance.org/agile101/the-agile-manifesto/) and [principles](http://www.agilealliance.org/agile101/12-principles-behind-the-agile-manifesto/) expressed in the Agile Manifesto.

For Agile, solutions evolve through collaboration between self-organizing, cross-functional teams utilizing the appropriate practices for their context.

DevOps builds on this.

## 7.10. How do they differ?

While DevOps extends Agile methods and practices by adding communication and collaboration between

- development,
- security,
- quality assurance, and
- technology operations

functionaries as stakeholders into the broader effort to ensure software systems are delivered in a reliable, low-risk manner.

## 7.11. Why?

In Agile Software Development, there is rarely an integration of these individuals outside the immediate application development team with members of technology operations (e.g., network engineers, administrators, testers, security engineers.)

## 7.12. What are the principles of DevOps?

As DevOps matures, several principles have emerged, namely the necessity for product teams to:

- Apply holistic thinking to solve problems,
- Develop and test against production-like environments,
- Deploy with repeatable and reliable processes,
- Remove the drudgery and uncertainty through automation,
- Validate and monitor operational quality, and
- Provide rapid, automated feedback to the stakeholders

## 7.13. Much of this is achieved

Through the repeated practices of Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) often conflated into simply "CI/CD" or "CICD".

WARNING: After tools, CICD is the next (**albeit mistakenly**) thing thought to be the totality of DevOps.

## 7.14. What is Continuous Integration (CI)?

It is a repeated Agile software development practice lifted specifically from Extreme programming, where members of a development team frequently integrate their work to detect integration issues as quickly as possible thereby shifting discovery of issues "left" (i.e., early) in the software release.

## 7.15. How?

Each integration is orchestrated through a CI service/orchestrator (e.g., [Jenkins](https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins), [Drone CI](https://github.com/drone/drone), GitLab Runners, Concourse CI) that essentially assembles a build, runs unit and integration tests every time a predetermined trigger has been met; and then reports with immediate feedback.

## 7.16. CI best practices

### 7.16.1. Utilize a Configuration Management System

For the software's source code, where the mainline (i.e., master branch) is the most recent working version, past releases held in branches, and new features not yet merged into the mainline branch worked in their own branches.

### 7.16.2. Automate the build

By accompanying build automation (e.g., Gradle, Apache Maven, [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)) alongside the source code.

### 7.16.3. Employ one or more CI services/orchestrators

To perform source code analysis via automating formal code inspection and assessment.

### 7.16.4. Make builds self-testing

In other words, ingrain testing by including unit and integration tests (e.g., Spock, JUnit, Mockito, SOAPUI, go package _Testing_) with the source code to be executed by the build automation to be executed by the CI service.

### 7.16.5. Never commit broken

Or untested source code to the CMS mainline or otherwise risk breaking a build.

### 7.16.6. Stakeholders are expected to pre-flight new code

Prior to committing source code in their own workspace.

### 7.16.7. The CI service/orchestrator provides feedback

On the success or fail of a build integration to all its stakeholders.

## 7.17. What is Continuous Delivery?

It is a repeated software development practice of providing a rapid, reliable, low-risk product delivery achieved through automating all facets of building, testing, and deploying software.

### 7.17.1. Extending Continuous Integration (CI)

With additional stages/steps aimed to provide ongoing validation that a newly assembled software build meets all desired requirements and thereby is releasable.

### 7.17.2. Consistency

Is achieved through delivering applications into production via individual repeatable pipelines of ingrained system configuration management and testing

## 7.18. But wait. What's a pipeline?

A pipeline automates the various stages/steps (e.g., Static Application Security Testing (SAST), build, unit testing, Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST), secure configuration acceptance compliance, integration, function and non-functional testing, delivery, and deployment) to enforce quality conformance.

## 7.19. How is a pipeline manifested?

Each delivery pipeline is manifested as **Pipeline as Code** (i.e., software automation) accompanying the application's source code in its version control repository.

## 7.20. What underlines all of this?

I and the community of practice argue DevOps will struggle without ubiquitous access to shared pools of software configurable system resources and higher-level services that can be rapidly provisioned (i.e., cloud).

Although, it is actually possible to [DevOps on mainframes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMS97X5ZTGc) The video is in the context of continuous delivery, but read between the lines.

## 7.21. But really why do we automate err. code?

In 2001, I think Larry Wall in his 1st edition of _Programming Perl_ book put it best with "We will encourage you to develop the three great virtues of a programmer:

laziness,

impatience, and

hubris."

The second edition of the same book provided definitions for these terms

### 7.21.1. Why do I mention Larry Wall?

Well...

Let me explain.

### 7.21.2. Laziness

> The quality that makes you go to great effort to reduce overall energy expenditure. It makes you write labor-saving programs that other people will find useful, and document what you wrote so you don't have to answer so many questions about it. Hence, the first great virtue of a programmer.\_ (p.609)

### 7.21.3. Impatience

> The anger you feel when the computer is being lazy. This makes you write programs that don't just react to your needs, but actually anticipate them. Or at least pretend to. Hence, the second great virtue of a programmer.\_ (p.608)

### 7.21.4. Hubris

> Excessive pride, the sort of thing Zeus zaps you for. Also, the quality that makes you write (and maintain) programs that other people won't want to say bad things about. Hence, the third great virtue of a programmer.\_ (p.607)

### 7.21.5. We automate for

- Faster, coordinated, repeatable, and therefore more reliable deployments.
- Discover bugs sooner. Shifting their discovery left in the process.
- To accelerates the feedback loop between Dev and Ops (Again, Ops is everyone not typically considered part of the development team.)
- Reduce tribal knowledge, where one group or person holds the keys to how things get done. Yep, this is about making us all replaceable.
- Reduce shadow IT (i.e., hardware or software within an enterprise that is not supported by IT. Just waiting for its day to explode.)

## 7.22. Monitoring

Once deployed, the work is done, right?

So, that improvements can be gauged and anomalies detected.A development team's work is not complete once a product leaves CICD and enters production; especially, under DevOps where the development team includes members of ops (e.g., security and technology operations).

### 7.22.1. The _primary_ metric

Is working software, but this is not the only, measurement. The key to successful DevOps is knowing how well the methodology and the software it produces are performing. Is the software truely dependable?

### 7.22.2. An understanding of performance

Is achieved by collecting and analyzing data produced by environments used for CICD and production.

### 7.22.3. Establish a baseline performance

So, that improvements can be gauged and anomalies detected.

### 7.22.4. Set reaction thresholds

To formulate and prioritize reactions weighting factors, such as, the frequency at which an anomaly arises and who is impacted.

### 7.22.5. Reacting

Could be as simple as operations instructing users through training to not do something that triggers the anomaly, or more ideally, result in an issue being entered into the product's backlog culminating in the development team delivering a fix into production.

### 7.22.6. Gaps in CICD

Are surfaces through monitoring resulting in for example additional testing for an issue discovered in prodcuction.

Yep. News flash. DevOps will not entirely stop all bugs or vulnerabilities from making it into production, but this was never the point.

### 7.22.7. Eliminating waste

Through re-scoping of requirements, re-prioritizing of a backlog, or the deprecation of unused features. Again, all surfaced through monitoring.

## 7.23. Crawl, walk, run

### 7.23.1. Ultimately, DevOps is Goal

- With DevOps one does not simply hit the ground running.
- One must first crawl, walk and then ultimately run as you embrace the necessary culture change, methods, and repeated practices.
- Collaboration and automation are expected to continually improve so to achieve more frequent and more reliable releases.

# 9. Prerequisites

The supported host operating systems for this class are OSX, Windows 11 and [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/). By "host operating system", I mean the computer you will use to work the class.

## 9.1. Manual inspection

It's a good idea to inspect the install scripts from projects you don't yet know. You can do that now by tromping around the project on GitHub. The project makes use of a [Makefile](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)#Makefile>), several [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) scripts, [Vagrant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagrant_%28software%29) and [Ansible](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ansible_(software)>) code. Looking through everything before you run it. If you dork up your host this was never my intention nor can I be held responsible as per the [License](./License), but I've made every effort to prevent this from happening. If read anything beyond this README please read the [License](./License) file.

## 9.2. Shell configuration

The class automation will configure [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/), [Zsh](https://www.zsh.org/) and [fish](https://fishshell.com/) [shell](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_(computing)>)s, as well as [neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) (nvim). A [Unix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix) shell is a command-line iterpreter, a command-line interface for the Unix or Unix-like operating systems, such as [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux). The shell exists in a [terminal emulator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_emulator). In this course we will either be [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) for OSX or [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/)' [Gnome Terminal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME_Terminal).

**NOTE**

- This class will link to an application, tool, library, etc's canonical git repository whenever possible, Wikipedia or its landing page.
- This class makes use of **NOTE** sections like this to call out things that are important to know or to drop a few tidbits. Reading these notes may save you some aggravation.

If you are on OSX and already have iTerm2 installed open a terminal window or use OSX built-in Terminal application by searching for "terminal" by clicking the Spotlight Search icon (if shown) in the Apple menu bar that runs along the top of the screen on your Mac beginning with an Apple icon. The Spotlight Search icon is a magnifying glass. Optionally, you can press `Command`-`Space bar` to open Spotlight Search.

If you have spent considerable time configuring your chosen shell, [neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) editor, etc it is advisable to back up your configuration by performing the following in the shell:

```bash
cp ~/.bash_profile ~/.bash_profile.back
cp ~.profile ~.profile.back
cp ~/.zshrc ~/.zshrc.back
cp ~/.zshenv ~/.zshenv.back
cp ~/.zprofile ~/.zprofile.back
cp ~/.zlogin ~/.zlogin.back
cp ~/.config/fish/config.fish ~/.config/fish/config.fish.back
cp ~/.config/nvim/init.vim ~/.config/nvim/init.vim.back
cp ~/.config/nvim/coc-settings.json ~/.config/nvim/coc-settings.json.back
```

**NOTE**

- When cutting-and-pasting from GitHub click on the clipboard icon in the uppper right-section of the code block.
- On or more of the above commands may fail if you don't have the file on your host. If you are sure you typed the command correctly you can ignore the error message.
- Use these backup files to recover your prior shell configuration. Just reverse the direction of the copy.

Now, we're going to to reset our configuration by performing the following

```bash
rm ~/.bash_profile ~/.zshrc ~/.zshenv ~/.zprofile ~/.zlogin ~/.config/fish/config.fish ~/.config/nvim/init.vim ~/.config/nvim/coc-settings.json
touch ~/.bash_profile ~/.zshrc
```

## 9.3. Installing upfront dependencies

You will need to install a number of upfront dependencies.

## 9.4. On OS X or Windows 11, install Docker Desktop

If your host (e.g., your laptop, personal computer) is running Windows 10 or OSX you will need to install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop). If you're using [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/), the [Ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible) automation will take care of installing [Docker](https://docker.io) for you and you can skip ahead to installing [Ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible). If you are using a version of Linux other than Arch then what's wrong with you? I'm kidding. You can use the Vagrant to execute the factory. Subsequent versions of this class will be updated to support [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/), [Rocky Lunux](https://rockylinux.org/), etc.

This class will use [Docker](https://docker.io) and so [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) must be installed and configured.

#### 9.4.0.1. On OSX, install Docker Desktop

If you're on an OSX host perform the following:

1. Download <https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop>
2. Drag the Docker app to your Application folder.
3. Find the Docker app in your applications folder and click to start the application.
4. You will need to verify that you want to trust the application by clicking `Open`.
5. The Docker Engine, actually a virtual machine (VM), will take sometime to start. You will then be asked to deny or accept `com.docker.backend` from accepting incoming network connections. Click `Allow`.
6. Find the Docker icon on the right side of your Apple menu bar and click and then select `preferences` from the menu.
7. In the `docker` window that opens, select the gear icon in the upper-right portion of the window.
8. Under `General` make sure `Start Docker Desktop when you log in` is checked off otherwise you will need to start docker everytime you restart your host.
9. Then select `Resources` on the left-hand side of the window.
10. As [Docker](https://docker.io) runs its containers in a virtual machine (VM), you will need to give this VM more processing power and host memory to run heavier container load. What you give the Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) VM is dependent on two factors the resources your host can spare and the load the class containers will place on your host. I'd advise trying 8 CPUs and 12 GBs of memory and scale as you see fit. Also, the class brings in a good number of container images. Give you yourself a `Disk image size` of 100 GB or larger. You may need more depending on whether not you have pull other images and are cacheing them. Consider doin a [docker image prune](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/image_prune/) to recover space. Pay attention to how much of your disk image is being used.
11. Click `Apply and Restart` to restart the Docker Desktop VM. The VM will take some amount of time to restart. The containers on the back of the whale icon (Moby Dock) will cycle the Apple menu bar will cycle until Docker is ready.

#### 9.4.0.2. On Windows, install Docker Desktop

TODO: Complete this section. I have plans to add this within a few weeks.

### 9.4.1. On Arch Linux, installing Docker

[Docker](https://docker.io) will be installed for you via the [Ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible) automation. [Ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible) will be discussed later.

## 9.5. On OSX, install iTerm2

If your using an OSX host, you can use Apple's default Terminal app for command line terminal, but I'd advise you to install the superior iTerm2.

Perform the following tasks:

1. Download the latest release from

   <https://iterm2.com/downloads/stable/latest>

2. Find the iTerm2 release zip file in your Downloads folder and double click.
3. Drag the iTerm2 app to your Application folder to install.
4. You will need to verify that you want to trust the application by clicking `Open`.
5. Use iTerm2 to perform the remaining command line tasks for this class.

# 10. Installing the software factory

This class uses a software factory hosted on a [Kubernetes (K8s)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/what-is-kubernetes/) cluster. K8s is an abbreviation of Kubernetes ("K" followed by 8 letters "ubernete" followed by "s"). (What a [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/what-is-kubernetes/) cluster is will be covered later.) To spin up the K8s cluster you will need to perform the following tasks in your shell.

## 10.1. Ansible

The class uses [Ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible) to install operating systems dependencies necessary for the class.

[Ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible) is a "configuration management" tool that automates software provisioning, configuration management and application deployment, two core repeated practices in DevOps, so for the class [Ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible) addresses this concern in the configuration of either your host operating system or a VM, if you've chosen to execute the class from a Vagrant.

Ansible was open-sourced and then later subsumed by Red Hat.

There are other notable open-source "configuration management" tools, such as [Chef](https://github.com/chef/chef) and [Puppet](https://github.com/chef/chef). Further, still there are others, such as [BOSH](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh) and [Salt](https://github.com/saltstack/salt), but they hold little or no community of practice or market share.

In his seminal essay, "The Cathedral and the Bazaar", Eric S. Raymond states

> while coding remains an essentially solitary activity, the really great hacks
> come from harnessing the attention and brainpower of entire communities
>
> You want to leverage the work of vibrate community and not some back water
> effort.

In [Ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible), one defines [playbooks](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks.html) to declaratively state desired configuration of a host. Yes, utilizing declarative programming vice imperative programming. With declarative programming your code essentially describes what you want, but not how to get what you want. With imperative programming, ones' code states what you want to happen step-by-step. The class will makes use of [Ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible), Kubernetes resource files and Helm charts to declare the desired end-state. These will be unpacked later in the class material. The truth is the two are often intermixed. Your [Ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible) playbooks can be a mix of declarative and imperative programming. One strives for the former rather than the later.

Each [Ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible) playbook is written in a [YAML](https://yaml.org/)-based DSL (domain specific language) following the [ansible-playbook schema](https://json.schemastore.org/ansible-playbook.json) enumerating all the tasks to be performed.

The playbooks for this class are located in the [ansible/](./ansible/) project sub-folder

```
ansible
├── common.yaml
├── docker.yaml
├── files
│   ├── coc-settings.json
│   └── init.vim
├── go.yaml
├── inspec.yaml
├── inventory.yaml
├── main.yaml
├── neovim.yaml
├── pyenv.yaml
├── ruby.yaml
├── sonar-scanner-cli.yaml
├── template-shell-configs.yaml
├── templates
│   ├── bash_profile.tpl
│   ├── config.fish.tpl
│   └── zshrc.tpl
└── yay.yaml
```

Each playbook is responsible for a unit of configuration. [ansible/files/](./ansible/files/) contains a number of files copied into the user space to configure the [neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) editor.

It also possible to collect these tasks into a collection referred to as a `role`. This class presently doesn't make use of roles.

### 10.1.1. Installing Ansible

The following sub-sections detail how to install [Ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible). Skip to the section that applies for your supported host.

### 10.1.2. On OSX, install the Xcode Command Line tools

I prefer to install the Xcode Command Line tools myself, but you could skip this step and have HomeBrew install it for you.

1. In iTerm2 enter the following into the command line.

   ```bash
   xcode-select --install
   ```

### 10.1.3. On OSX, install HomeBrew

Homebrew is as the project refers to itself, "The Missing Package Manager for macOS." These days the project also tacks on "(or Linux)". Package managers A package manager automates the process of installing, upgrading, configuring, and removing binaries from an operating system.

I could of had the [Ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible) playbook install this dependency, but I'd rather you become familiar with the fact there is in fact a community driven package manager for OSX.

Install brew by performing the following:

```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

Success resembles

### 10.1.4. On Rocky 8, ensure Python3 and pip are installed

Rocky 8 will already include both Python 3 and pip installed, but Ansible will require Python 3.8 or newer on the controller starting with Ansible 2.12, so lets fix that

```bash
sudo dnf install python39 python39-pip -y
```

Output will resemble

As we have multiple Python versions installed we have to configure Rocky to default to version 3.9. We can do that be peforming the following

```bash
sudo update-alternatives --set python /usr/bin/python3.9
sudo update-alternatives --set python3 /usr/bin/python3.9
```

We can verify

```bash
python --version
python3 --version
```

Output will resemble for both

```
Python 3.9.2
```

Also, let's update pip

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip --user
```

Output will resemble

```

### 10.1.5. Install Ansible

[Ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible) is based on [Python](https://www.python.org/) ans distributed as a Python module that you can install by [pip](https://pip.pypa.io). Pip refers to itself as "the package installer for Python". There are [others](https://packaging.python.org/guides/tool-recommendations/), but most everyone uses pip.

In the command line perform the following task:

Type the following

```bash
python3 -m pip install --user ansible
```

This will install the [Ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible) module into the Python user install directory for your platform. Typically this results in the [Ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible) binaries being installed into the `.local/bin` sub-folder in the user's home directory (i.e., `$HOME/.local/bin`)

Output will resemble

[![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/VcmeRa4foy8qU9HKjghd4rUsf.svg)](https://asciinema.org/a/VcmeRa4foy8qU9HKjghd4rUsf)

In order to use the paramiko connection plugin or modules that require paramiko, install paramiko

```bash
python3 -m pip install paramiko
```

Output will resemble

[![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/425731.svg)](https://asciinema.org/a/425731)

[Ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible) is now installed in your home directory in `$HOME/.local/bin` path, where is `$HOME` is an environment variable holding the path to your home directory.

But if you enter the following into the shell

```bash
which ansible-playbook
```

the output will likely be

```
ansible-playbook not found
```

The [`which`](https://linux.die.net/man/1/which) command will attempt to locate a program file in the user's path.

You are likely using the Bash shell at this point. To check type `echo $SHELL` into your shell. Depending on what is returned perfom what is appropriate for your shell.

If your shell is [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/):

```bash
if [[ "$OSTYPE" == "darwin"* ]] && [[ "${PATH}" != *"$HOME/Library/Python/3.8/bin"* ]]; then 'export PATH=$HOME/Library/Python/3.8/bin' >> ~/.bash_profile; fi
if [[ "${PATH}" != *"/usr/local/bin"* ]]; then echo 'export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bash_profile; fi
if [[ "${PATH}" != *"$HOME/.local/bin"* ]]; then echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile; fi
source ~/.bash_profile
```

If your shell is [Zsh](https://www.zsh.org/):

```zsh
if [[ "$OSTYPE" == "darwin"* ]] && [[ "${PATH}" != *"$HOME/Library/Python/3.8/bin"* ]]; then 'export PATH=$HOME/Library/Python/3.8/bin' >> ~/.bash_profile; fi
if [[ "${PATH}" != *"/usr/local/bin"* ]]; then echo 'export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.zshrc; fi
if [[ "${PATH}" != *"$HOME/.local/bin"* ]]; then echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc; fi
source ~/.zshrc
```

If you're using [fish](https://fishshell.com/):

```bash
echo 'set -U fish_user_paths $HOME/Library/Python/3.8/bin $fish_user_paths' >> ~/.config/fish/config.fish
echo 'set -U fish_user_paths $HOME/.local/bin $fish_user_paths' >> ~/.config/fish/config.fish
echo 'set -U fish_user_paths /usr/local/bin $fish_user_paths' >> ~/.config/fish/config.fish
source ~/.config/fish/config.fish
```

to add the [Ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible) executables and the binaries the Ansible automation may install to your path. The `PATH` environment variable is a list of directories that your shell searches through when you enter a command.

Note that we updated our `PATH` and sourced our shell configuratiion thereby updating our present shell we can verify `ansible` has been installed via

```bash
ansible-playbook --version
```

Output will resemble

```
ansible-playbook [core 2.11.4]
  config file = None
  configured module search path = ['/home/vagrant/.ansible/plugins/modules', '/usr/share/ansible/plugins/modules']
  ansible python module location = /home/vagrant/.local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/ansible
  ansible collection location = /home/vagrant/.ansible/collections:/usr/share/ansible/collections
  executable location = /home/vagrant/.local/bin/ansible-playbook
  python version = 3.6.8 (default, May 19 2021, 03:00:47) [GCC 8.4.1 20200928 (Red Hat 8.4.1-1)]
  jinja version = 3.0.1
  libyaml = True
```

Let's test to see if [Ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible) works on our host by executing

```bash
ansible localhost -m ping
```

Output should resemble

```
[WARNING]: No inventory was parsed, only implicit localhost is available
localhost | SUCCESS => {
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
```

The fact that `ping` returns `pong` indicates [Ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible) has been installed correctly.

You will need to perform the following in the shell to add [community.general](https://galaxy.ansible.com/community/general) Ansible module from [Ansible Galaxy](https://galaxy.ansible.com/), Ansible’s official hub for sharing [Ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible) content.

For example, on an OSX host, we'll need this to install `brew` packages and for [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/) we'll need this to install operating systems package via [pacman](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Pacman) package manager.

```bash
ansible-galaxy collection install community.general
```

Successful output should resemble

```
Starting galaxy collection install process
Process install dependency map
Starting collection install process
Downloading https://galaxy.ansible.com/download/community-general-3.3.1.tar.gz to /home/nemonik/.ansible/tmp/ansible-local-1333943849hwygv/tmplq_el1ud/community-general-3.3.1-d99hf7_o
Installing 'community.general:3.3.1' to '/home/nemonik/.ansible/collections/ansible_collections/community/general'
community.general:3.3.1 was installed successfully
```

## 10.2. Run the Ansible playbook

The rest of the class will require a number of operating system dependencies be installed. We will accomplish the via executing the [./ansible/main.yaml](./ansible/main.yaml) playbook.

First we will need to [git clone](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone) the class repository by performing the following in your shell

```bash
mkdir -p $HOME/Development/workspace
cd $HOME/Development/workspace
git clone https://github.com/nemonik/hands-on-DevOps-gen2.git
cd hands-on-DevOps-gen2
```

### 10.2.1. Reviewing the Ansible playbooks

If you haven't reviewed the playbooks, now is a good time to do so.

Enter the project's [ansible/](./ansible) sub-folder

```bash
cd ansible
```

The `ansible-playbook` command will execute a series of playbooks across an inventory of hosts. For the class we have just one host and this is `localhost`, your host.

The contents of `inventory.yaml` file is in `ansible` folder written in [YAML](https://yaml.org/) following [Ansible Inventory shema](https://json.schemastore.org/ansible-inventory.json) and resembles

```
all:
  children:
    factory:
      hosts:
        localhost:
          ansible_connection: local
          ansible_host: localhost
          ansible_python_interpreter: /usr/bin/python3
      vars:
        default_delay: 10
        default_retries: 60
        ruby_version: 3.0.1
        supported_host_os:
          - MacOSX
          - Archlinux
    ungrouped: {}
```

Where

- `factory` is a group name used in classifying hosts.
- `localhost` is the alias for your host.
- `ansible_host`, `ansible_connection` and `ansible_python_interpreter` are behavioral inventory parameters used to control haw Ansible interacts with your host.
  - `ansible_host` describes the name of the host to connect to. This parameter is redundant in this instance.
  - `ansible_connection` describes the connection type used to connect to the host. In our case this set to `local`. Another type would be `ssh` if the host was remote.
  - `ansible_python_interpreter` describes the target host's python path. Python is "batteries included" on OSX and will be found on [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/).
- `vars` describes a number of variables uses across the playbooks: `default_delay`, `default_retries`, `ruby_version` and `supported_host_os`.
  - `default_delay` sets the number of seconds to delay between retries.
  - `default_retries` sets the number times a task will be retried before Ansible gives up.
  - `ruby_version` sets the ruby version to install, and
  - `supported_host_os` is a list of supported operating systems.

A playbook is composed of one or more _plays_ in an ordered list, where plays are executed in order from top to bottom. Most Ansible modules (also referred to as “task plugins” or “library plugins”) check whether the desired state has already been achieved and the playbook will move on without performing any actions once the desired state has been achieved. This is refered to as being _idempotent_.

Let's look at the [ansible/main.yaml](./ansible/main.yaml) playbook.

```
---
- name: Install factory dependencies
  hosts: factory
  tasks:
    - name: Echo ansible distribution
      ansible.builtin.debug:
        msg: "{{ inventory_hostname }} host is running {{ ansible_distribution }}:{{ ansible_distribution_release }} with an IP address if {{ ansible_default_ipv4.address }}"

    - name: Fail if OS is not MacOSX or ArchLinux
      ansible.builtin.fail:
        msg: "{{ ansible_distribution }} - {{ ansible_distribution_release }} is not MacOSX or ArchLinux"
      when: ansible_distribution not in supported_host_os
```

The lines above name the playbook and state the group name (in this case `factory` correlated with the inventory) this playbook will be applied to. Followed by two tasks that will be executed.

The first task, `ansible.builtin.debug` is used for debugging purposes. The second, `ansible.builtin.fail` tests whether or not the host is supported.

We can retrieve the documentation for both in the shell via using the [`ansible-doc`](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/cli/ansible-doc.html) command. For example, if we enter

```bash
ansible-doc ansible.builtin.debug
```

into the shell, it will return

```
> ANSIBLE.BUILTIN.DEBUG    (/Users/nemonik/.local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/ansible/modules/debug.py)

        This module prints statements during execution and can be useful for debugging variables or
        expressions without necessarily halting the playbook. Useful for debugging together with the
        'when:' directive. This module is also supported for Windows targets.

  * note: This module has a corresponding action plugin.

OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- msg
        The customized message that is printed. If omitted, prints a generic message.
        [Default: Hello world!]
        type: str

- var
        A variable name to debug.
        Mutually exclusive with the `msg' option.
        Be aware that this option already runs in Jinja2 context and has an implicit `{{ }}' wrapping,
        so you should not be using Jinja2 delimiters unless you are looking for double interpolation.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- verbosity
        A number that controls when the debug is run, if you set to 3 it will only run debug when -vvv
        or above.
        [Default: 0]
        type: int
        version_added: 2.1
        version_added_collection: ansible.builtin


NOTES:
      * This module is also supported for Windows targets.

    - "Provisioning based on YOUR_KEY which is: {{ lookup('env', 'YOUR_KEY') }}"
    - "These servers were built using the password of '{{ password_used }}'. Please retain this for later use."
```

And the playbook continues on to importing and executing each of the following playbooks

```ansible
- name: When ArchLinux ensure Docker is installed
  ansible.builtin.import_playbook: docker.yaml

- name: When ArchLinuc ensure yay AUR helper is installed
  ansible.builtin.import_playbook: yay.yaml

- name: Ensure common dependencies are installed
  ansible.builtin.import_playbook: common.yaml

- name: Ensure pyenv is installed and configured
  ansible.builtin.import_playbook: pyenv.yaml

- name: Ensure sonar-scanner cli is installed and configured
  ansible.builtin.import_playbook: sonar-scanner-cli.yaml

- name: Ensure rvm and ruby {{ ruby_version }} is installed
  ansible.builtin.import_playbook: ruby.yaml

- name: Ensure InSpec is installed
  ansible.builtin.import_playbook: inspec.yaml

- name: Ensure neovim is installed and configured
  ansible.builtin.import_playbook: neovim.yaml

- name: Ensure Go is installed and configured
  ansible.builtin.import_playbook: go.yaml

- name: Template in shell configs
  ansible.builtin.import_playbook: template-shell-configs.yaml
```

I'd encourage you to review them all, but lets look at a portion of the first to be imported and executed, the [./ansible/common.yaml](./ansible/common.yaml) playbook

```ansible
---
- name: Ensure common dependencies are installed
  hosts: factory
```

Again, the playbook is named and states the group name this playbook will be applied to.

```ansible
  tasks:
    - name: Set fact for $HOME
      ansible.builtin.set_fact:
        HOME: "{{ lookup('env', 'HOME') }}"
```

Followed in by executing a number of tasks. The first being to create a fact to hold the HOME environment variable.

```ansible
    - name: When MacOSX ensure Homebrew packages are installed
      block:
        - name: Update homebrew and upgrade all packages
          community.general.homebrew:
            update_homebrew: yes
            upgrade_all: yes

        - name: Check if /usr/local/Cellar/bash-completion exists
          ansible.builtin.stat:
            path: /usr/local/Cellar/bash-completion
          register: bash_completion

        - name: Ensure bash-completion is not installed, so bash-completion@2 can be installed
          ansible.builtin.shell: brew unlink bash-completion
          when: bash_completion.stat.exists

        - name: Ensure HomeBrew packages are installed
          community.general.homebrew:
            name:
              - bash
              - bash-completion@2
              - zsh
              - zsh-completion
              - fish
              - vim
              - nano
              - pwgen
              - openssl
              - watch
              - gettext
              - k3d
              - helm
              - curl
              - wget
              - git-secrets
              - tmux
              - yamllint
              - jq
              - tree
              - htop
              - kubectl
            state: latest
          retries: "{{ default_retries }}"
          delay: "{{ default_delay }}"
          register: result
          until: result is succeeded

        - name: Get HOMEBREW_PREFIX
          block:
            - name: Execute brew --prefix
              ansible.builtin.shell: brew --prefix
              register: brew_prefix

            - name: Create brew_fact with stdout of of prior command
              ansible.builtin.set_fact:
                HOMEBREW_PREFIX: "{{ brew_prefix.stdout }}"
      when: ( ansible_distribution == 'MacOSX' )
```

First, the `when` condition will be evaluated to determine if the host to be "ansible-ized" is running OSX before [Ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible) runs each of the tasks in the block.

The block collects the following tasks:

1. `community.general.homebrew` is used to update the host's installed packages,
2. `ansible.builtin.stat` checks and holds in a register where or not the `/usr/local/Cellar/bash-completion` path exists on the host.
3. `ansible.builtin.shell` executes `brew` to unlink `bash-completion` thereby ensuring the the wrong `bash-completions` package is not installed, but only if the path had been found.
4. `community.general.homebrew` tries repeatedly to install a list of HomeBrew packages until they're installed or the maximum number of retries are reached.
5. A sub-block ends out the run with
   1. `ansible.builtin.shell` executing `brew --prefix` and storing the result in a register
   2. `ansible.builtin.set_fact` is used to hold the standard output (stdout) of `brew--prefix` command in a Ansible fact, `HOMEBREW_PREFIX`.

The [./ansible/common.yaml](./ansible/common.yaml) playbook continues until completion and then you are returned to the [./ansible/main.yaml](./ansible/main.yaml) to execute the next playbook. I'd encourage you to review each.

If your on LinkedIn or search many of the job boards you'll find many employers equate infrastructure-as-code as DevOps. Infrastructure-as-code is a DevOps methodology but not the entirety of DevOps.

### 10.2.2. Install dependencies

Now that we've reviewed the playbook lets execute it via the [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) target `install-dependencies` in the root of the project in our shell

```bash
if [[ "$OSTYPE" == "darwin"* ]]; then brew install bash; /usr/local/bin/bash; fi
export PATH="~/.local/bin/:/usr/local/bin:$PATH"
cd $HOME/Development/workspace/hands-on-DevOps-gen2
make install-dependencies
```

**NOTES**

- Pay attention to the playbook's run as it may stop to ask you for your password.
- The password asked for out of the gate is needed, so that [Ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible) can become the root and install system-wide packages and software.
- You may be asked again when installing fonts, so keep an eye out for this.
- The first line runs only if you re on OSX to install a [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) 5. OSX ship with [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) 3.2.57(1)-release.
- Some tasks are long running. I've put debug statements prior to these tasks. Look for them if you think [Ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible) has froze. It likely has not.
- How long this takes to run is dependent on the speed of your Internet connection.

The output should resemble

[![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/0dldJSH5189opfqyInl5p61Ou.svg)](https://asciinema.org/a/0dldJSH5189opfqyInl5p61Ou)

The last bit of output is important

```
META: ran handlers
META: ran handlers

PLAY RECAP ******************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
localhost                  : ok=135  changed=65   unreachable=0    failed=0    skipped=34   rescued=0    ignored=1
```

If `failed ` equals something other than `0` then you have an issue to debug. Debuging will require you to review the task that resulted in the failure likely the last task run. Review the output, determine what playbook you were in, open and review the playbook and the offending task and then try the equivalent in the command line to debug the issue. The host may be in a state the playbook cannot handle. Perhaps a dependency is missing. Perhaps. Perhaps. Perhaps.

### 10.2.3. On OSX, enable nerd fonts in XTerm2

XTerm2 must be further configured to benefit from the Nerd Fonts installed by [Ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible). We're going to configure XTerm2 to use `Meslo Nerd Font` and use `Solarized Dark` color theme. Optionally, you can select another [Nerd font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads).

1. Open iTerm2's `Preferences`.
2. In the `Preference` window that opens, select `Profile`.
3. In the `Default` profile, select `Text`.
4. In the `Text` profile, select `Meslo Nerd Font` from the `Font` panel.
5. In the `Preferences` window, select `Color`.
6. Click `Color Preserts...` and select `Solarized Dark`.
7. Close the `Preference` windows, and re-start your terminal window for your changes to take effect.
8. Close iTerm2 and restart it.

### 10.2.4. On Arch Linux, enable nerd fonts in the Gnome Terminal

The Gnome Terminal must be further configure to benefit from the Nerd Fonts installed [Ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible). We're going to configure Terminal to `Meslo Nerd Font` and use `Solarized Dark` color them. Optionally, you can select another [Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads).

1. Open Terminal's `Preferences`.
2. In the `Preference` window that opens, select the `Unamed` profile.
3. In the `Text` panel, check off `Custom font` and select `Meslo Nerd Font`. Size as per your eyesight.
4. In the `Colors`panel, unclick `Use colors from system theme` and select `Solarized dark` from the available built-in themes.
5. Close the `Preference` windows.
6. Close and restart Gnome Terminal and your Terminal should of updated as per your selections.

### 10.2.5. Change your shell to fish

The class automation will attempt to configure [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/), [Zsh](https://www.zsh.org/) and [fish](https://fishshell.com/), but let's try something perhaps new. Further information on [fish](https://fishshell.com/) can be found in its [documentation](http://fishshell.com/docs/current/index.html), but essentially it syntax highlighting, autosuggestions, and tab completion along with some other improvements that in my opinion pushes it past my prior shell, [Zsh](https://www.zsh.org/).

Let's use [fish](https://fishshell.com/) as our shell

On OSX type

```bash
sudo chsh -s $(which fish) $(whoami)
```

On Arch Linux

```bash
chsh -s $(which fish) $(whoami)
sudo reboot
```

On OSX, simply closing your current terminal and opening a new one should be enough for the change to take, but for Arch you appear to have to logout or reboot.

**NOTE**

- Effort was take to support [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/), [Zsh](https://www.zsh.org/), and [fish](https://fishshell.com/), but preference was given to [fish](https://fishshell.com/), so if there are flaws in the course they'll be discovered using [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) and [Zsh](https://www.zsh.org/).

### 10.2.6. Finish conifiguring fish

If you are going to use the fish shell consider using the [tide](https://github.com/IlanCosman/tide) prompt. To configure

```fish
tide configure
```

**NOTE**

- A shout out to [@IlanCosman](https://github.com/IlanCosman) for helping me figure out my fish path issue.

### 10.2.7. Finish configuring neovim

The class automation will attempt to configure [neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) (nvim) installing [junegunn/vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) a plugin manager, a number of additional plugins to include a language server.

The plugins installed

- [tpope/vim-commentary](https://github.com/tpope/vim-commentary) to comment stuff out when in nvim's "normal" mode you just type `gcc`.
- [junegunn/vim-easy-align](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-easy-align) to align text when in "visual" mode.
- [ctrlpvim/ctrlp.vim](https://github.com/ctrlpvim/ctrlp.vim) to provide a finder.
- [preservim/nerdtree](https://github.com/preservim/nerdtree) to provide a file tree explorer, when in "normal" mode press thje `space` key followed by the `n` key.
- [Xuyuanp/nerdtree-git-plugin](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree-git-plugin) to extend NERDTree to show git status,
- [tiagofumo/vim-nerdtree-syntax-highlight](https://github.com/tiagofumo/vim-nerdtree-syntax-highlight) to extend NERDTree with extra syntax and highlighting.
- [airblade/vim-gitgutter](https://github.com/airblade/vim-gitgutter) to show in sign column which lines have been added, modified, or removed when in a git repository.
- [tpope/vim-fugitive](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive) to provide a git command functionality in the editor.
- [vim-airline/vim-airline](https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline) to provide a status/tabline.
- [vim-airline/vim-airline-themes](https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline-themes) to provide themes to the vim-airline status/tabline.
- [preservim/nerdcommenter](https://github.com/preservim/nerdcommenter) to comment stuff out. I haven't settled on whether i I like thise plugin or `tpope/vim-commentary`. To comment out a line in either normal/visual mode type `space` followed by `cc`.
- [NLKNguyen/papercolor-theme](https://github.com/NLKNguyen/papercolor-theme) to provide both light and dark schemes. I've selected `PaperColor` color scheme later in the [ansible/files/init.vim](./ansible/files/init.vim).
- [fatih/vim-go](https://github.com/fatih/vim-go) to install the official Go development plugin.
- [neoclide/coc.nvim](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim) to install and configure a language server. I've configured the language server to install a number of extensions:
  - [coc-go](https://github.com/josa42/coc-go), a Go language server extension using `gopls`.
  - [coc-pyright](https://github.com/fannheyward/coc-pyright), a Python3 language server extension.
  - [coc-solargraph](https://github.com/neoclide/coc-solargraph), a Ruby language server extension using `solargraph`.
  - [coc-spell-checker](https://github.com/iamcco/coc-spell-checker), a basic spell checker that works with camelCase code.
  - [coc-json](https://github.com/neoclide/coc-json), a Json language server extension.
  - [coc-yaml](https://github.com/neoclide/coc-yaml), a fork of [vscode-yaml](https://github.com/redhat-developer/vscode-yaml) that provides a YAML language server extension.
  - [coc-angular](https://github.com/iamcco/coc-angular), an [Angular](https://github.com/angular/angular) language server extension.
  - [coc-html](https://github.com/neoclide/coc-html), an HTML language server extension.
  - [coc-snippets](https://github.com/neoclide/coc-snippets) provides a snippets solution.
  - [coc-prettier](https://github.com/neoclide/coc-prettier) provides Coc extension to format a numbe of file types using [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier). To run the prettier command line interface enter `npx prettier` in the shell.

I'll be honest I use most of these plugins and extensions, some more than others. A few I have yet to fully learn.

When you first start `nvim` on the command-line you will be greated with a number of warning/error messages. This is because the [ansible/files/init.vim](./ansible/files/init.vim) copied to your `~/.config/nvim/init.vim` is pre-configure to use the plugins yet to be installed.

You must now install them while in visual mode. Just press the `esc` to get past the error messages and then type `:PlugInstall` and `junegunn/vim-plug` will install the plugins described above. `coc` language server should then take over and install its own extensions, but you may have to close the status window type `:q!` and then restart `nvim` for langauge server to install its extensions. Pressing `:q!` will close Coc's status window.

I would really love to teach you about `vi`, `vim` and `nvim`, but doing so is really outside the scope of this class. I've really been an avid [nano](https://www.nano-editor.org/) user, but capable of using `vi` in a pinch as it almost always garunteed to be installed in [Unix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix)-like operating system. Neovim pushed me over the cliff to use it fill time. And I'm focused to learn `nvim`. This is is why `nano` is aliased to `nvim`, so if you enter `nano` into the the shell it will start instead `nvim`. You can override this by typing nano's full path, `/usr/local/bin/nano` on OSX and `/usr/bin` on Arch. You can strip the alias out of your shell initialization file or for a session map it back the the `alias` command.

`vi`, `vim` and `nvim` pointers:

- I'd encourage you to read vim's [docs](https://www.vim.org/docs.php).
- Read through the [FAQ](https://vimhelp.org/vim_faq.txt.html).
- Give [VIM Adventures](https://vim-adventures.com/) some play.
- Print out [Allison McKnight's cheat sheet](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~15131/f17/topics/vim/vim-cheatsheet.pdf) or search the Internet for another.

We will be using `nvim` in the class, but I won't know if you're using something else.

## 10.3. Spin up the Factory

So, now that you have the prerequisite dependencies, it is time to move on to spinning up the factory.

The factory tools are entirely execute on a containerized [Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes) cluster hosted on [k3s](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s) (Rancher Lab’s minimal [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/what-is-kubernetes/) distribution) on Docker created by [k3d](https://github.com/rancher/k3d/). [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/what-is-kubernetes/) is used to orchestrate the life cycles the long-running tools (e.g., [Taiga](https://www.taiga.io/), [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/rluna-gitlab/gitlab-ce), Docker CI, [SonarQube](https://github.com/SonarSource/sonarqube/), [Heimdall 2](https://github.com/mitre/heimdall2). [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/what-is-kubernetes/) is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. Essentially, [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/what-is-kubernetes/) serves as an operating system for a cluster of computing resource (in the cases of [k3d](https://github.com/rancher/k3d/) these computing resources themselves are containers) and manages the life cycle and discovery of the applications running upon the cluster.

Initially, [k3s](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s) was billed as a light-weight (Its less than 40 MB binary completely implements the Kubernetes API.), [fully CNCF certified](https://github.com/cncf/k8s-conformance/pulls?q=is%3Apr+k3s) [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/what-is-kubernetes/) distribution designed for resource-constrained environments (It can run on host with as little as 512MB RAM.), not needing the added steps and dependencies a full [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/what-is-kubernetes/) cluster would require. Keep in mind memory and compute equates to money when it comes to cloud, so why burn memory and computer err. money when you don't have to. It installs in a fraction of the time it takes to launch a canonical Kubernetes cluster. As [k3s](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s) has matured it has become just a darn good [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/what-is-kubernetes/) distribution.

It's canonical source can be found at

<https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s>

It's landing page can be found here

<https://k3s.io/>

The official documentation can be found here

<https://rancher.com/docs/k3s/latest/en/>

### 10.3.1. The `Makefile`

I've chosen to author the automation for spinning up the factory in [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/). [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) bills itself as "a tool which controls the generation of executables and other non-source files of a program from the program's source files." Created by, [Stuart Feldman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuart_Feldman) Make introduced in PWB/UNIX has been around since 1976. Yep, over 45 years ago. Initially, its purpose was to automate software builds. Yeah, automation one of the core methods of DevOps has been around quite a long time. I've chosen to use [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) since the inception of my class to drive this point home. There's alway a few "grey beards" in my class that perk up and smile after hearing it mentioned. [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) lends itself well to the task of spinning up the cluster, the tools, etc as a makefile is essentially a collection of rules. An individual rule in the makefile tells [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) how to execute a series of commands. The [./Makefile](./Makefile) is found at the root of the repository. As I stated earlier, typically [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) is utilized for building code, but because of its ubiquity across Linux and OSX it is often used for a wide variety of tasks. We're going to use it stand up a [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/what-is-kubernetes/) cluster and a top that entire DevOps factory. Maybe this was a wrong decision. Only time will tell.

First let's inspect the [Makefile](./Makefile) in piecemeal.

#### 10.3.1.1. The copyright

```
# Copyright (C) 2021 Michael Joseph Walsh - All Rights Reserved
# You may use, distribute and modify this code under the
# terms of the the license.

The above is the copyright. The BSD 3-clause license allows you nearly almost unlimited freedom with the course material so long as you include the BSD copyright and license notice. I can not be held responsible if you damage you host for example. You may also not use my name in the endorsement of derived products.

#### 10.3.1.2. The Makefile rules

```
.PHONY: all install-dependencies pull-class-images install-k3s-air-gap-image start install start-registry delete-registry start-pullthrough stop-pullthrough uninstall-pullthrough start-cluster delete-cluster patch-coredns install-traefik uninstall-traefik install-gitlab uninstall-gitlab install-drone uninstall-drone install-taiga uninstall-taiga install-sonarqube uninstall-sonarqube install-heimdall uninstall-heimdall install-plantuml uninstall-plantuml decrypt-vault encrypt-vault load-cached-images
```

Generally, a [Makefile](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)#Makefile>) is comprised of rules that look like this

```
target [optionally, additional targets...] : prerequisite [optionally, additional prerequisite]
        recipe
        ...
```

Each rule begins with a line that defines usually one sometimes more than one target followed by a colon and optionally a number of files or targets on which the target depends. Followed by a tab indented recipe comprised of one or more tab indented lines. When building source code, the target is a file, but in the instance where you want your makefile to run a series of commands that do not represent physical files on the file system you are executing what make considers a "phony" target. Phony targets are the name of the recipe. [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) provides a built-in target named `.PHONY` where you can make your target a prerequisite of it thereby declaring your target to be phony. This is what I've done above for all of my targert. The `.PHONY` line could be skipped and the makefile will still work, but including the line makes the makefile more readable once you know what a phony target is.

What follows next are the makefile's rules

```
all: install-dependencies start install
start: start-pullthrough start-registry install-k3s-air-gap-image pull-class-images start-cluster patch-coredns

	./decrypt-vault.sh
encrypt-vault:
	./encrypt-vault.sh
```

Earlier we entered `make install-dependencies` in our shell to install all the dependencies via [Ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible). Well, we can see above the `install-dependencies` target executes a [./install_dependencies.sh](install_dependencies.sh) shell script.

#### 10.3.1.3. Explaining `make all`

In the shell, if you were to enter `make all` make would execute the `all` target, who will in turn

- execute the `start` target, who in turn will call
  - the `start-pullthrough` target, who will descend into the [./pullthrough-registry](./pullthrough-registry) sub-folder and execute [install.sh](./pullthrough-registry/install.sh) [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) script
  - tehe `start-registry` target, who will execute the [./start_registry.sh](start_registry.sh) [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) script
  - the `pull-class-images` target, who will execute the [./pull_class_images.sh](./pull_class_images.sh) [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) script
  - the `install-k3s-air-gap-image`, who who will descend into the [./k3s-air-gap-image](./k3s-air-gap-image) sub-folder and execute [install.sh](./k3s-air-gap-image/install.sh) [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) script
  - the `pull-class-images` target, who will execute the [./pull_class_images.sh](./pull_class_images.sh) [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) script
  - the `start-cluster` target will be called execute the [./start_cluster.sh](start_cluster.sh) script
  - and then finally the `patch-coredns` target will be called, descend into the [./coredns](./coredns) sub-folder and execute the [patch.sh](./coredns/patch.sh) script
- then execute the `install` target, who will call
  - the `install-traefik` target, descend into the [./traefik](./traefik) sub-folder and execute the [install.sh](./traefik/install.sh) script
  - then the `install-gitlab` target to descend into the [./gitlab](./gitlab) sub-folder and execute the [install.sh](./gitlab/install.sh) script
  - then the `install-drone` target to descend into the [./drone](./drone) sub-folder and execute the [install.sh](./drone/install.sh) script
  - then the `install-taiga` target to descend into the [./taiga](./taiga) sub-folder and execute the [install.sh](./taiga/install.sh) script
  - then the `install-sonarqube` target to descend into the [./sonarqube](./sonarqube) sub-folder and execute the [install.sh](./sonarqube/install.sh) script
  - then the `install-heimdall` target to descend into the [./heimdall](./heimdall) sub-folder and execute the [install.sh](./heimdall/install.sh) script
  - and finally, the `install-plantuml` target to descend into the [./plantuml-server](./plantuml-server) sub-folder and executes the [install.sh](./plantuml-server/install.sh) script

### 10.3.2. Configuring the pull through container registry

The factory will pull a great number of images. Docker permits anonymous free users the ability to pull 100 on the docker.io container registry per six hours and authenticated free users a total of 200 pulls per six hours. You can sign up for a free authenticated account at <https://hub.docker.com/signup>.

Back in your shell you can login you use the docker cli to login. The apropos is `docker login [OPTIONS] [SERVER]`. If you don't provide a `[SERVER]` it is assumed your intention is to log into Docker's public registry by default.

```bash
docker login -u <your username>
```

In the above example you are providing your username out of the gate.

If during the class you encounter errors where you cannot pull the necessary images. Consider paying the 7 dollars for a Pro account <https://www.docker.com/pricing> It is 7 dollars if you pay monthly or 5 dollars/month if pay 60 dollars for a year up front. With the Pro account you can make 5000 pulls on docker.io's container registry per day.

The class can be configured to make use of a pull through registry to mitigate the need, but really nothing can be done if you're anonymous image requests are from a private network with others anonymous users doing the same. A pull through registry will cache the image you request, so the next time you request the same image the registry will pull the image from the cache vice docker.io.

To enable the pull through registry, edit the [./.env](./.env) file at the root of the project and enable the pull through registry via

```bash
nvim ./..env
```

then scrolling to you see

```
## pullthrough container registry
pullthrough_registry_enabled=false
```

and setting `pullthrough_registry_enabled` equal to `true`.

You will then need to configure Docker daemon to use it.

1. Open the Docker Desktop dashboard
2. Select `Settings` (The gear icon on the upper-right)
3. Select `Docker Engine`
4. In the box under `Configure the Docker daemon by typing a json Docker daemon configuration file.`

   ```
   {
     "registry-mirrors": [
       "http://localhost:5001"
     ],
     "builder": {
       "gc": {
         "defaultKeepStorage": "20GB",
         "enabled": true
       }
     },
     "debug": true,
     "experimental": false
   }
   ```

   And add the lines

   ```
     "registry-mirrors": [
       "http://localhost:5001"
     ],
   ```

If you are using Arch linux, edit `/etc/docker/daemon.json` and add the line. I'll update the Ansible at a later date to do this for you.

The class will also cache all its images into [./image_cache](./image_cache) folder that is empty when you clone the class. You can re-install these images into you local Docker cache via

```bash
~/Development/workspace/hands-on-DevOps-gen2/load_cached_images.sh
```

K3s will pull the images it needs to run directly from docker.io when using the canonical container image. I've provided a Dockerfile in [./k3s-air-gap-image](./k3s-air-gap-image) that will build in the containers. The K3s project provides all these images as tar-ball.

### 10.3.3. Creating and using your own Let's Encrypt wildcard SSL certificate

To use this class:

1. I will have provided you the password to decrypt the [vault](./vault) file containing [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) wildcard SSL certificate and private key for the nemonik.com domain, or
2. You will need to own a domain for which you can register a certificate for and then place the full certificate chain and key into the vault file as I did.

You likely will fall into the later catagory as I don't typically handout this password and will need to perform the following. If I'm teaching you this class in person I likely will provide the [vault](./vault) password and so you can skip to followig section on starting the cluster.

If you have your own domain, you can generate a [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) wildcard SSL certficate for free using [Certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/) provided by the [Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)](https://www.eff.org/). If you don't have a domain, how to register a domain is outside the scope of this class. Might I suggest you use [dynadot.com](https://dynadot.com). My Refer-a-friend code is `06U759R6b8a9D9H`, you can enter this code upon registering your domain for a $5 account credit.

I've used the term wildcard SSL certificate a couple times now. What is it? Well, a wildcard certificate is a certificate with a wildcard character (\*) in the domain name filed to permit the certificate to secure multiple sub domains of a base domain. For example, all the tools of the factory are configure by default to exist as subdomains of nemonik.com. GitLab exists at https://gitlab.nemonik.com, Taiga exists at https://taiga.nemonik.com, etc. Access to these applications are reverse proxied by [Traefik](https://github.com/traefik/traefik). [Traefik](https://github.com/traefik/traefik) also handles encrypting the HTTP traffic to these tools. Arguably we could create self-signed certificates, but self-signed certificates can be problematic resulting in your Web browser, curl and wget thowing certificate errors. [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) SSL certificates are commonly used in practice, so I figured I might as well cover their creation and use in this class.

#### 10.3.3.1. Edit `domain` in the dotenv file

First open the dotenv file ([./.env](./.env)) in the neovim editor and edit the following line

```bash
domain="nemonik.com"
```

replacing `nemonik.com` with your domain.

#### 10.3.3.2. Creating your wildcard certificate

The [Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)](https://www.eff.org/) provides instructions for how to use [Certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/) at <https://certbot.eff.org/instructions> for many operating systems.

The following is not meant to replace these instuctions.

If you are using Archlinux ensure the `certbot` package is installed

```bash
sudo pacman -S certbot
```

If you are using OS X ensure the brew package is installed

```bash
brew install certbot
```

`certbot` will be installed by Ansible [./ansible/common.yaml](./ansible/common.yaml) playbook in the future.

The following commands can be used to both create and renew [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) SSL certificates.

```bash
 sudo certbot -d "*.nemonik.com" --server https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory --manual --preferred-challenges dns certonly
```

replacing `nemonik.com` with your domain.

[Certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/) will produced the following output:

```
Please deploy a DNS TXT record under the name
_acme-challenge.nemonik.com with the following value:

a random-string-of-characters

Before continuing, verify the record is deployed.
(This must be set up in addition to the previous challenges; do not remove,
replace, or undo the previous challenge tasks yet. Note that you might be
asked to create multiple distinct TXT records with the same name. This is
permitted by DNS standards.)

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Press Enter to Continue
```

You will now need to add a TXT record containing the `random-string-of-characters` for the `_acme-challenge` sub-domain with your domain registrar.

Registrars have various ways of doing this. [dynadot.com](https://dynadot.com) documents how to do this at <[dynadot.com](https://dynadot.com)>. [GoDaddy](https://godaddy.com) documents how to do this for their service at <https://www.godaddy.com/help/add-a-txt-record-19232>. Just use your registrar's search or web search for your registrar's name plus `create a txt record` to learn how to do the same for your registrar.

You can move things along by setting a short time to live.

Do not immediately press `Enter` to continue in [Certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/) as it takes time for your new DNS entry to propoagate across the Internet.

The best way I found to be sure your change has propogated is to use <https://www.whatsmydns.net/#TXT/_acme-challenge.nemonik.com> replacing `_acme-challenge.nemonik.com` with the fully qualified domain name of your your TXT record. You can refresh your browser to watch as the TXT record is propogated across the Internet.

You also can use either the `dig` or `host` command to check on the propoagation of the your TXT record like so

```bash
dig -t txt _acme-challenge.nemonik.com
```

will output

```
; <<>> DiG 9.16.20 <<>> -t txt _acme-challenge.nemonik.com

```

when the TXT record has propogated.

`host` executed like so

```bash
host -t txt _acme-challenge.nemonik.com
```

will return rather simply

```
_acme-challenge.nemonik.com descriptive text "ozbMVFpscNW6p0RpnDJUP9_mWAiXC-IyNDdfEnoKGMA
```

If you press `Enter` and [Certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/) fails you will have update your TXT record and try again.

The TXT record is no longer needed once you pres Enter and [Certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/) creates your certificate chain and key.

The certifate chain and key wil placed into `/etc/letsencrypt/live`. The README file will explain what the file are. I'd encourage you to read it. You will not be able to access the contents of this directory unless your are the root user.

```bash
sudo su
cd /etc/letsencrypt/live/
```

`cd` into the path that starts with your domain. In my case this is `nemonik.com-0002`, so I would

```bash
cd nemonik.com-0002
```

This path also contains a README. I'd encourage you to read it. Its contents are

```
This directory contains your keys and certificates.

`privkey.pem`  : the private key for your certificate.
`fullchain.pem`: the certificate file used in most server software.
`chain.pem`    : used for OCSP stapling in Nginx >=1.3.7.
`cert.pem`     : will break many server configurations, and should not be used
                 without reading further documentation (see link below).

WARNING: DO NOT MOVE OR RENAME THESE FILES!
         Certbot expects these files to remain in this location in order
         to function properly!

We recommend not moving these files. For more information, see the Certbot
User Guide at https://certbot.eff.org/docs/using.html#where-are-my-certificates.
```

You will need the `fullchain.pem` and `privkey.pem` file.

You willl need to base64 encode each of these files like so

```bash
cat fullchain.pem | base64 > fullchain.pem.base64
cat privkey.pem | base64 > privkey.pem.base64
```

Doing so will create two new files that contain the contents of the original base64 encoded.

In another shell in the root of the project create a new vault file like software

```bash
mv vault vault.origin
nvim vault
```

Start the fill with the following content

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
read -d '' traefik_tls_crt << EOF
```

Copy the base64 encoded contents of `fullchain.pem.base64` directly following indenting each line 3 characters like software

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
read -d '' traefik_tls_crt << EOF
   LS0t...

   several lines each indented
                            ...LS0t
   Cg==
```

In your editor add on a new line the following

```bash
EOF
```

In your editor add another line with the contents `read -d '' traefik_tls_key << EOF` then copy the base64 contents of `privkey.pem.base64` followed by a new line containing `EOF`, so the file now looks like

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
read -d '' traefik_tls_crt << EOF
   LS0t...

   several lines each indented
                            ...LS0t
   Cg==
EOF
read -d '' traefik_tls_key << EOF
   LS0t...

   several lines each indented
                            ...LS0tLS0K
EOF
```

You can opt not to encrypt the [./vault](./vault) file, but I'd encurage you to encrypt it like so

```bash
 export VAULT_PASSWORD=`pwgen -Bsv1 20`
echo $VAULT_PASSWORD
```

Copy the value of `VAULT_PASSWORD` to your Keychain, BitVault or some other password manager so as to not forget it.

The contents of [./vault](./vault) file are retrieved by the Traefik automation to create `traefik-cert` Secret Kubernetes resource on the cluster in the `traefik` namespace, so that Traefik can SSL encrypt the traffic to the factory tools.

You can now proceed to the following section. Note, you wil not be accessing the tools on the nemonik.com domain though. You will need to use your domain to access the tools (e.g., <https://gitlab.YOUR-DOMAIN>, <https://traefik.YOUR-DOMAIN>).

### 10.3.4. Starting the cluster

Starting the cluster involves a number [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) rules as described earlier.

We will utilize at least one container registry for our [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/what-is-kubernetes/) cluster, a private registry and optionally a pull through registry. We utilize these registries for essentially two reasons

1. So, that K3s pulls from this registry vice going directly to docker.io even for our custom container images. If you've enabled and configured your Docker to use pull through registry it pull through this registry before making requests of the docker.io registry.
2. To hold our private container images.

For our factory to access either registry it will need to be able to resolve the fully qualified domain name of the registry. For our host to do this we will utilize entries in our host's `hosts` file. Both OSX and Linux operating systems have this file located at `/etc/hosts`.

Edit your `/etc/hosts` with `nvim` like so

```bash
sudo nvim /etc/hosts
```

and add to the end the following, so these domains can be resolved

```
127.0.0.1 host.k3d.internal
127.0.0.1 k3d-registry.nemonik.com
```

`127.0.0.1` is your host's [loopback address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Localhost). The first entry, `host.k3d.internal` is the name the cluster refers to the host as, and `k3d-registry.nemonik.com` is entry for the private container registry. You will be making additional edits to this file so that your browser can resolve the fully qualified domains of the factory's long running tools.

You can move forward by entering the [vault](./vault) file password, but you'll be asked repeatedly for it, I would suggest setting an environment variable to hold the value

```bash
 export VAULT_PASSWORD=super-secret-password
```

If you put a `space bar` character before `export` the environment variable `VAULT_PASSWORD`and its value wont be entered into your shell's history thereby protecting its value from being plucked.

Then execute the makefile `start` rule

```bash
cd $HOME/Development/workspace/hands-on-DevOps-gen2
make start
```

The output will resemble

[![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/HOHOqza78Ttaabx7IqpzCM9Wx.svg)](https://asciinema.org/a/HOHOqza78Ttaabx7IqpzCM9Wx)

#### 10.3.4.1. The `start-pullthrough` rule

In this particular instance I also enabled the pull through container registry and so [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) created it, whose output resembled

```
cd pullthrough-registry && ./install.sh
Setting unsecured variables into current context...
pullthrough registry already exists.
Now running...

Ensure your docker daemon configure file contains:

  {...
  "registry-mirrors": ["http://host.k3d.internal:5001"],
  ...}

to use use your pullthrough registry.
./start_registry.sh

```

**NOTES**

- The [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) scripts will make use of color for informational purposes.
  - Yellow is used to notify
  - Red is used to warn
  - Blue is use to clue you in that the script expects user input

#### 10.3.4.2. The `start-registry` rule

The private container registry will be started in this case the registry all ready existed and just needed to be restarted, but if it hadn't it would of been created. Output to create the registry would resemble the following

```
./start_registry.sh
Setting unsecured variables into current context...

INFO[0000] Starting Node 'k3d-registry.nemonik.com'
INFO[0001] Successfully created registry 'k3d-registry.nemonik.com'
# You can now use the registry like this (example):
# 1. create a new cluster that uses this registry
k3d cluster create --registry-use k3d-registry.nemonik.com:5000

# 2. tag an existing local image to be pushed to the registry
docker tag nginx:latest k3d-registry.nemonik.com:5000/mynginx:v0.1

# 3. push that image to the registry
docker push k3d-registry.nemonik.com:5000/mynginx:v0.1

# 4. run a pod that uses this image
kubectl run mynginx --image k3d-registry.nemonik.com:5000/mynginx:v0.1

Waiting til k3d-registry.nemonik.com:5000 is running...
Now running.
```

If the [registry](https://hub.docker.com/_/registry) container is already running or needs to be restart this will be handled as well.

Folllowing the private registry, [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) will build a private K3s container with the air gapped container images, whose out output will resemble

```
cd k3s-air-gap-image && ./install.sh
Setting unsecured variables into current context...

```

#### 10.3.4.3. The `install-k3s-air-gap-image` rule

K3s' canonical container image will pull a number of container images directly from the docker.io registry. The K3s project provides guidance on how to configure K3s when executing K3s directly on a host in air gap environment, the instructions apply to when K3s is containerized. The `install-k3s-air-gap-image` rule will retrieve a [tarball](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tar_(computing)#File_format>) of the container images K3s needs to run and will build a new container image including the [tarball](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tar_(computing)#File_format>), so as to remove the need to for the nodes of the cluster to retrieve these container images on start up.

#### 10.3.4.4. The `pull-class-images` rule

Then the class images will be pulled from their remote registries, tagged and pushed into the private registry. In this case I already had many of the images in Docker's cache and so I did not need to retrieve them. There is a lot of redundant output in this [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) rule not worth copying here.

[Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) then moves on to executing the `start-cluster` rule, where the [./start_cluster.sh](start_cluster.sh) script will pause

```
Attempting to load secrets from /Users/nemonik/Development/workspace/hands-on-DevOps-gen2/vault...

```

seeking input from the user. What the script is asking for is password to decrypt the [vault](./vault) at the root of the project. This file contains the following variable whose values are secret. I will share them with MITRE students, but not others. When unencrypted the file resembles

```bash
# Copyright (C) 2021 Michael Joseph Walsh - All Rights Reserved
# You may use, distribute and modify this code under the
# terms of the the license.
#
# You should have received a copy of the license with

read -d '' traefik_tls_crt << EOF
   LS0tLS1CRUd...
   ... a whole bunch more lines
   Cg==
EOF
read -d '' traefik_tls_key << EOF
   LS0tLS1CRUd...
   ... a whole bunch more lines
EOF
```

The `traefik_tls_crt` variable holds the Lets Encrypt certificate chain for wildcard dns entry (\*.nemonik.com) and `traefik_tls_key` holds the private key.

Why are these needed? Well, the cluster's HTTP reverse Proxy service,[Traefik](https://github.com/traefik/traefik) will respond to requests recieved. Each factory tool will register a fully qualified domain name with [Traefik](https://github.com/traefik/traefik), for example [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/rluna-gitlab/gitlab-ce) will register `gitlab.nemonik.com` and since most modern browsers force the use of HTTPS a wildcard cert must be configure in [Traefik](https://github.com/traefik/traefik) so that proper certificate are presented to the browser in response otherwise the browser will choke and warn that it doesn't trust Traefiks default self-signed certificate.

Back to `make start-cluster` if you entered the password or had set it in an environmental variable the output will resemble

```

=======================================================
Your host IP is 192.168.65.2
Writing 192.168.65.2 into /tmp/host_ip
=======================================================

=======================================================
Ensure the following lines are in your /etc/hosts file:
=======================================================

127.0.0.1 host.k3d.internal
127.0.0.1 gitlab.nemonik.com
127.0.0.1 drone.nemonik.com
127.0.0.1 taiga.nemonik.com
127.0.0.1 sonar.nemonik.com
127.0.0.1 plantuml.nemonik.com
127.0.0.1 heimdall.nemonik.com
127.0.0.1 k3d-registry.nemonik.com
127.0.0.1 helloworld.nemonik.com
```

The purpose of the rule is to add DNS entries for the factory tools into [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/what-is-kubernetes/), so the tools can resolve each other. Without this for example when you you attempt to authenticate into [Drone CI](https://github.com/drone/drone), and it OpenAuths off of [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/rluna-gitlab/gitlab-ce), [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/rluna-gitlab/gitlab-ce) won't be able to resolve Drone in DNS. None of this would be necessary if we had control of an external DNS server.

The script ends reminding you to add the following lines to your `/etc/hosts` file

```
127.0.0.1 gitlab.nemonik.com
127.0.0.1 drone.nemonik.com
127.0.0.1 taiga.nemonik.com
127.0.0.1 sonar.nemonik.com
127.0.0.1 plantuml.nemonik.com
127.0.0.1 heimdall.nemonik.com
127.0.0.1 k3d-registry.nemonik.com
127.0.0.1 helloworld.nemonik.com
```

You do this via running nvim as root (i.e., `sudo nvim /etc/hosts`) to edit the hosts file and add the lines above.

**NOTES**

- Your host IP address (`192.168.65.2`) will likely be different for you.

- If you are using your own domain then `nemonik.com` will b:e replaced with whatever you've provided the `domain` variable in the [.env](./.env) file.

### 10.3.5. Verifying the cluster is up and running

The [k3s](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s) cluster should now be up and running. Let's verify this by entering into your shell

```bash
kubectl get nodes -o wide
```

Output should resemble

```
NAME                                 STATUS   ROLES                  AGE   VERSION        INTERNAL-IP   EXTERNAL-IP   OS-IMAGE   KERNEL-VERSION     CONTAINER-RUNTIME
k3d-hands-on-devops-class-server-0   Ready    control-plane,master   11m   v1.21.1+k3s1   172.18.0.3    <none>        Unknown    5.10.25-linuxkit   containerd://1.4.4-k3s2
k3d-hands-on-devops-class-agent-0    Ready    <none>                 11m   v1.21.1+k3s1   172.18.0.4    <none>        Unknown    5.10.25-linuxkit   containerd://1.4.4-k3s2
```

The `STATUS` of each node should be `Ready`. Our cluster by default has two nodes: one server node who provides the control-plane and is a master node, whereas the other is an agent node.

Above is the wide output providing more information. You could of just entered `kubectl get nodes` and only get back in return the first five columns worth of information.

Our cluster is also already running pods. Enter the following into your shell

```bash
kubectl get pods -A -o wide
```

Output will resemble

```
NAMESPACE     NAME                                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE   IP          NODE                                 NOMINATED NODE   READINESS GATES
kube-system   local-path-provisioner-5ff76fc89d-nqs99   1/1     Running   0          17m   10.42.1.2   k3d-hands-on-devops-class-agent-0    <none>           <none>
kube-system   metrics-server-86cbb8457f-f5zrj           1/1     Running   0          17m   10.42.0.3   k3d-hands-on-devops-class-server-0   <none>           <none>
kube-system   coredns-85546dbd9-t244v                   1/1     Running   0          16m   10.42.1.3   k3d-hands-on-devops-class-agent-0    <none>           <none>
```

You'll see the coredns service whose data we patched.

The `-A` option tells `kubectl` to list the pods across all namespaces. The `-o wide` option again returns additional information. The `-o` option can also return output in `yaml`, `json`, etc. If you leave `-o wide` off, you'll just get the first 6 columns of output.

`docker ps` will be show these containers runnning

```

```

### 10.3.6. Starting the factory tools

Now that we have a cluster up and running we can install all the long running factory tools ([Taiga](https://www.taiga.io/), [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/rluna-gitlab/gitlab-ce), [Drone CI](https://github.com/drone/drone), etc) upon it.

```bash
cd $HOME/Development/workspace/hands-on-DevOps-gen2
make install
```

**NOTE**

- To save yourself from enterinng the `VAULT_PASSWORD` repeatedly set it as an environment variable, ` export VAULT_PASSWORD=super-secret-password` then execute the `make install`.
- If the GitLab install appears stuck doing the following for like ever. It is normal for it to loop doing this for a bit, but not forever.

  ```
  Still waiting for GitLab to respond to https requests...
  Still waiting for GitLab to respond to https requests...
  Still waiting for GitLab to respond to https requests...
  Still waiting for GitLab to respond to https requests...
  Still waiting for GitLab to respond to https requests...
  ```

  You didn't update your `/etc/hosts` file with the values provided by the [./coredns/patch.sh](./coredns/patch.sh) script.

  To fix this perform the following.

  ```bash
  cd $HOME/Development/workspace/hands-on-DevOps-gen2
  make patch-coredns
  ```

  And add the entries it tells you to as covered in the prior section and then re-run the `make install`.

This is a long running process as each install rule will be execute triggering a tool's install script. Each install script retrieves the container images related to the factory tool being installed and then executes one or more Helm charts and applies zero or more [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/what-is-kubernetes/) resource files followed by possibly additional steps to ensure the desired state of the tool is on the cluster

[![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/0N1KzcDazU199HuGDt65hWjxL.svg)](https://asciinema.org/a/0N1KzcDazU199HuGDt65hWjxL)

In another shell you can watch the tools spin up

```bash
watch -n 15 kubectl get pods -A
```

Whose output will resemble.

[![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/DWOM2COUJtzmRZ06gCKIjzj81.svg)](https://asciinema.org/a/DWOM2COUJtzmRZ06gCKIjzj81)

Pop some corn it will be a while. Faster than the video as all the container images where cached.

## 10.4. The long-running tools

The result is the following factory spun up

![Deployment diagram](diagrams/deployment.svg)
[PlantUML source for this diagram](plantuml/deployment.puml)

The class makes use of two types of tools: those that are long-running (e.g., [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/rluna-gitlab/gitlab-ce), Drone, [SonarQube](https://github.com/SonarSource/sonarqube/)) and those used to perform short-lived individual tasks (e.g., [Makefile](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)#Makefile>, [InSpec](https://github.com/inspec/inspec), OWASP-ZAP.)

This section will describe the long-running tools leaving subsequent sections to describe the latter as you use the short-lived tools.

### 10.4.1. Taiga, an example of Agile project management software

[Taiga](https://www.taiga.io/) is an Open Source project management platform for managing Agile Development projects.

Typically, Agile teams work using a visual task management tool such as a project board, task board, Kanban or Scrum visual management board. These boards can be implemented using a whiteboard or open space on the walls of a room with colored index cards taped to them or in software. The board is at a minimum segmented into a few columns _To do_, _In process_, and _Done_, but the board can be tailored. I've personally seen boards for very large projects consume every bit of wall space of a very large cavernous room, but as Lean-Agile has matured, teams have grown larger and more disparate, tools have emerged to provide a clear view into a project's management to all levels of concern (e.g., developers, managers, product owner, and the customer) answering:

- Are deadlines being achieved?
- What is the work in progress?
- Are team members overloaded?
- How much is complete?
- What's next?

Further, the Lean-Agile Software tools should provide the following capabilities:

- Dividing integration and development effort into multiple projects.
- Defining, allocating, and viewing resources and their workload across each product.
- Defining, maintaining, and prioritizing the accumulation of an individual product's requirements, features or technical tasks which, at a given moment, are known to be necessary and sufficient to complete a project's release.
- Facilitating the selection and assignment of individual requirements to resources, and the tracking of progress for a release.
- Permit collaboration with external third parties.

The 800 pound Gorilla in this market segment is JIRA Software. I and some of my co-workers loath it. It is part of the Atlassian suite providing provides collaboration software for teams with products including JIRA Software, Confluence, Bitbucket, and Stash. Back when Atlassian (Stocker ticker: TEAM) was trading at 50-dollars it was a good investment. It feel more like a ticketing systems in comparison to the others.

**NOTE**

- Lean-Agile Project Management software's primary purpose is to integrate people and really not much else.

#### 10.4.1.1. Documentation, source, container image

[Taiga](https://www.taiga.io/)'s documentation can be found at

<https://docs.taiga.io/>

It's canonical source can be found at

<https://github.com/kaleidos-ventures/taiga-front>

dedicated to the front-end, and

<https://github.com/kaleidos-ventures/taiga-back>

dedicated to the back-end.

[Taiga](https://www.taiga.io/) up until recently didn't directly offer a container images for [Taiga](https://www.taiga.io/), but that has since changed. You can find this here

<https://hub.docker.com/u/taigaio>

They also have a project using [Docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) ( a tool for defining and running multi-container applications) to stand up [Taiga](https://www.taiga.io/) attempt

<https://github.com/kaleidos-ventures/taiga-docker>

But this is not used to stand up [Taiga](https://www.taiga.io/) in the class. I authored a Helm chart to do this found here

<https://github.com/nemonik/taiga-helm>

And the chart is published to my Helm Chart repository

<https://nemonik.github.io/helm-charts>

#### 10.4.1.2. URL, username and password

Once, stood up the [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/what-is-kubernetes/) cluster your instance of Taiga will reachable by default at

<https://taiga.nemonik.com>

The default username is

`root@taiga.nemonik.com`

whose password is

`password` (Shhhh. Our little secret.).

**NOTE**

- The URL for the class [Taiga](https://www.taiga.io/) will be this unless you changed the value of the `taiga_fdqn` variable in the [.env](./.env) file to something else, generated a Let's Encrypt cert for the wildcard of your domain and entered the values
  `traefik_tls_crt` and `traefik_tls_key` into the [vault](./vault) at the root of the project. The same goes for the rest of the long running tools.

### 10.4.2. GitLab CE, an example of configuration management software

[GitLab](https://gitlab.com/rluna-gitlab/gitlab-ce) is installed on the [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/what-is-kubernetes/) cluster, where it will be accessible at <https://gitla.nemonik.com>.

[GitLab Community Edition (CE)](https://gitlab.com/rluna-gitlab/gitlab-ce) is an open source end-to-end software development platform with built-in version control, issue tracking, code review, and CICD.

For Agile teams to collaborate, a Configuration management (CM) is necessary to coordinate the development of new feature, changes, and experimentation. Also, a CM system (CMS) provides a history of changes, and thereby, the ability to roll back to a version known to be acceptable.

At a minimum, the following items will be placed under revision control in CM:

- Source code,
- If a database is needed, schema initialization and the migration between versions,
- Text documentation containing

  - a synopsis (i.e., project name, overview, etc.),
  - version description,
  - guidance covering

    - build,
    - unit testing, and
    - installation

  - a contributor enumeration,

  - license and/or ownership declaration with contacts, etc.,

A single CMS and the associated workflow (e.g., GitHub Workflow) can serve as the focal point for the entire enterprise thereby provide centralized version control if all documentation is authored in a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax (e.g., Markdown, PlantUML).

A CMS must facilitate best practices, not limited to:

- A means for developers to copy and work off a complete repository thereby permitting

  - Private individual work to later be synchronized via exchanging sets of changes (i.e., patches) through a means described as "distributed version control", and
  - Pre-flight build and test of their source code in their own private workspace, so as to minimize the chance of committing broken or untested source code thereby encouraging
  - The committing of completed source code only.

- Granular commits that communicate the motivation for the commit (i.e., the what and why). For example, for a change these could be:

  - the inclusion of a new feature,
  - a bug fix,
  - the removal of dead code

- Reducing the risk breaking a build by

  - Utilizing branching to separate different lines of development, and
  - Standardizing on CMS workflows (e.g., GitHub Workflow),

- [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) builds be self-testing (i.e., ingrain testing) by including unit and integration test with the source code so that it can be executed by

  - the build automation, and
  - the Continuous Integration service.

- Trigger follow-on activities orchestrated by the Continuous Integration Service.

#### 10.4.2.1. Documentation, source, container image

[GitLab](https://gitlab.com/rluna-gitlab/gitlab-ce)'s documentation can be found at

<https://docs.gitlab.com/ce>

It's canonical source can be found at

<https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce>

I'm using Sameer Naik's container image for [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/rluna-gitlab/gitlab-ce) built from GitLab CE's source. Up until recently GitLab did not offer a monolithic container image for running GitLab, but now does at <https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/install/docker.html>. I'm using Sameer's container image simply out preference as it is has been long maintained and solid reputation.

Sameer's container image can be found at

<https://hub.docker.com/r/sameersbn/gitlab/>

Whose canonical source is located at

<https://github.com/sameersbn/docker-gitlab>

I've written a Helm chart for it located at

<https://github.com/nemonik/sameersbn-gitlab-helm>

#### 10.4.2.2. URL, username and password

Once, stood up your instance of [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/rluna-gitlab/gitlab-ce) will reachable by default at

<https://gitlab.nemonik.com>

You will be using the [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/rluna-gitlab/gitlab-ce)'s **root** account to host your repositories versus creating your own, but if you want you can. There is nothing stopping you.

For the purposes of the class the

`root`

account's password has been set to the uber-secure

`paswword`

So, you will be asked to change it to your own 8-character password when using GitLab for the first time.

### 10.4.3. Drone CI, an example of CICD orchestrator

Drone is essentially a Continuous Delivery system built on container technology.

Drone is distributed as a set of container images. [Drone CI](https://github.com/drone/drone) can be run with an internal SQLite database, but it can be run with an external database . It also integrates with multiple version control providers (i.e., GitHub, [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/rluna-gitlab/gitlab-ce), BitBucket, Stash, and Gogs). Both CMS and database are configured using environment variables passed along when the [Drone CI](https://github.com/drone/drone) container is first to run. The `.drone.yml` is authored in a domain specific language (DSL) that is a superset of the docker-compose DSL. The file is used to describe the build with multiple named steps with each step executed in a separate containers having shared disk access to the checked out branch of the source repository. Steps make use of Drone plugins to deploy code, publish artifacts, send a notification, etc. Drone's approach is novel as plugins are really just container images distributed in the typical manner. Each plugin is designed to perform pre-defined tasks and is configured as steps in your pipeline. The containers are executed with read/write/execute access at the root of the source branch therefore permitting the pipeline to interact with that specific, checked out branch of the source.

Drone and its brethren (e.g., [Jenkins](https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins), GitLab Runners) are used to facilitate Continuous Integration (CI), a software development practice where members of an Agile team frequently integrate their work in order to detect integration issues as soon as possible. Each integration is orchestrated through a service that essentially assembles a build and runs tests every time a predetermined trigger has been met and then reports with immediate feedback.

I don't use Jenkins unless I have to. Why? I'm simply not a fan. Initially, because its plugin architecture is painful to manage and with prior versions your pipelines existed entirely in the [Jenkins](https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins) tool itself. Later, [Jenkins](https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins) introduced Groovy-based Jenkin Pipelines that are CMed (i.e., placed under configuration management) with your project's source. And while every orchestrator has based their DSL on YAML and although I love the Groovy language for its power, but I don't think it makes for a good orchestration language. Your opinion may differ. I'm okay with that. Really. I am.

There are also SaaS CICD tools, such as Travis CI and Circle CI. These are great, free CICD orchestrators.

My [java-stix](https://github.com/STIXProject/java-stix) project hosted on GitHub.com uses both Travis CI and Circle CI as part of its continuous integration.

The [Travis CI orchestration](https://github.com/STIXProject/java-stix/blob/master/.travis.yml) contains

```yaml
language: java
dist: precise
jdk:
  - oraclejdk7

before_install:
  - chmod +x gradlew

env: GRADLE_OPTS=-Dorg.gradle.daemon=true
env: CI_OPTS=--stacktrace

install: /bin/true
script: "./gradlew -x signArchives"
```

Whereas, the [Circle CI orchestration](https://github.com/STIXProject/java-stix/blob/master/circle.yml) contains

```yaml
machine:
  java:
    version: oraclejdk7
  environment:
    GRADLE_OPTS: -Dorg.gradle.daemon=true
    CI_OPTS: --stacktrace --debug

test:
  override:
    - ./gradlew -x signArchives
```

They are essentially similar with both requiring the Oracle JDK and use Gradle to build and unit test the code. Both of these services under the covers use containers to run the builds.

In another GitHub hosted project, the [java-stix-validator](https://github.com/STIXProject/java-stix-validator) the [Travis CI orchestration](https://github.com/STIXProject/java-stix-validator/blob/master/.travis.yml) contains

```yaml
language: java
jdk:
  - oraclejdk8
before_install:
  - chmod +x gradlew
env: CI_OPTS=--stacktrace
install: "/bin/true"
script: "./gradlew build -d"
deploy:
  provider: heroku
  api_key:

To deploy the web application to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com), one of the first PaaS (Platforms-as-Service). The code was last committed in 2015 and the code is still running free on Heroku at <http://agile-journey-9583.herokuapp.com/#/>

More details on Drone is sprinkled across the class. As you can see I favor being a polyglot when it comes to software development to include CICD.

### 10.4.5. PlantUML Server, an example of light-weight documentation

The second value in the Agile Manifesto is

> Working software over comprehensive documentation

The documentation for this class, this `readme.md` file, is authored in Markdown, a light-weight markup language. The course's diagrams are authored in [PlantUML](https://www.plantuml.com), a domain-specific language used to author well-formed and human-readable code to render UML diagrams.

For me, I don't need to see the diagrams rendered to follow them. The code alone is sufficient.

PlantUML supports a number of UML diagrams: Sequence, Use Case, Class diagram, Activity diagram, Component, State, Object, Deployment, and Timing. The DSL also supports a number of other non-UML diagrams: Wireframe graphical interface, Specification and Description Language (SDL), Ditaa diagram...

This class makes use of just two types: Activity and Deployment diagrams. The diagrams are especially helpful to visual learners. Each PlantUML diagram's source file exist in [plantuml folder](plantuml) in the root of the project and is rendered by a [GitHub workflow](.github/workflows/main.yml) into scalable vector graphic (SVG) that is pushed to the [diagrams folder](diagrams) upon changes committed to each diagram's source file.

The PlantUML effort also provides server for rendering diagrams in PNG, SVG or LaTeX formats. Plugins for Microsoft Code, Atom, and other editors have been authored to assist in authoring in the PlantUML DSL.

#### 10.4.5.1. Documentation, source, container image

PlantUML's main site and documentation is at

<https://www.plantuml.org>

PlantUML's canonical source can be found here

<https://github.com/plantuml>

I'm using the container image provided at

<https://hub.docker.com/r/plantuml/plantuml-server>

The aforementioned workflow is using

<https://hub.docker.com/r/think/plantuml>

to render the diagrams.

#### 10.4.5.2. URL

Once, stood up your instance of PlantUML server will reachable by default at

<https://plantuml.nemonik.com>

The PlantUML Server stores no user data. You will not be asked to authenticate.

### 10.4.6. Heimdall 2

[Heimdall 2](https://github.com/mitre/heimdall2) is a security results viewer and review tool supporting multiple security results formats, such as: [InSpec](https://github.com/inspec/inspec), [SonarQube](https://github.com/SonarSource/sonarqube/), OWASP-Zap and Fortify.

#### 10.4.6.1. Documentation, source, container image

[Heimdall 2](https://github.com/mitre/heimdall2)'s canonical source can be found here

<https://github.com/mitre/heimdall2>

I've written a Helm chart to install on [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/what-is-kubernetes/) whose repository can be found here

<https://github.com/nemonik/heimdall2-helm>

#### 10.4.6.2. URL, username and password

Once, stood up your instance of [Heimdall 2](https://github.com/mitre/heimdall2) server will reachable by default at

<https://heimdall.nemonik.com>

To create an account perform the following:

1. Open Heimdall 2 in your browser (e.g., <https://heimdall.nemonik.com>).
2. Click `SIGN UP` in the lower right of the pop up by default this will open <https://heimdall.nemonik.com/signup>.
3. Enter your first and last name (e.g., First Name: `Turd`, Last Name: `Ferguson` ).
4. Provide an email (e.g., `root@nemonik.com`).
5. Being this a security application you're going to be asked to provide a secure password (You'll be warned, _Passwords are a minimum of 15 characters in length. Passwords must contain at least one special character, number, upper-case letter, and lower-case letter. Passwords cannot contain more than three consecutive repeating characters. Passwords cannot contain more than four repeating characters from the same character class._) Provide a secure password (.e.g., `sup3rS3cr3tCr3d3nt1@ls!`).
6. Then login with with the email you provided (e.g., `root@nemonik.com`) and the password you provided (e.g., `sup3rS3cr3tCr3d3nt1@ls!`), and click `Login`.

# 11. Golang `helloworld` project

The [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/what-is-kubernetes/) cluster and the long running tools are required to be up and running for the following sections.

In this next part, we will create a simple helloworld GoLang project to demonstrate Continuous Integration. GoLang lends itself well to DevOps and underlines almost every new tool you can think of related to DevOps and cloud (e.g., [golang / go](https://github.com/golang/go), [docker / docker-ce](https://github.com/docker/docker-ce), [kubernetes / kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes), [openshift / origin ](https://github.com/openshift/origin), [hashicorp / terraform](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform), [coreos / etcd](https://github.com/coreos/etcd), [hashicorp / vault](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault), [hashicorp / packer](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer), [hashicorp / consul](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul), [gogits / gogs](https://github.com/gogits/gogs), [drone / drone](https://github.com/drone/drone).)

## 11.1. Create the project's backlog

A backlog is essentially your (or your team's) to-do list, a prioritized list of work derived from the road map (e.g., the outline for future product functionality and when new features will be released) and its requirements.

Open [Taiga](https://www.taiga.io/) (e.g., <https://taiga.nemonik.com>) in your web browser.

The default username is

`root@nemonik.com`

whose password is

`password`

These will be different if you changed the class configuration.

Complete the follow to track your progress in completing the Golang _helloworld_ project

1. Click `Create Project`.
2. Select `Kanban`. In a Kanban board work moves from left to right with each column represents a stage within the value stream.
3. Give your project a name. For example, `Helloworld` and a description, such as, `My Kanban board for this awesome helloworld app` and then click `CREATE PROJECT`.
4. You can skip this step and opt to chose to click `<` to fold `READY`, `USER STORY STATUS` and `ARCHIVED` only after completing step 6. Otherwise, you can edit your Kanban board to just `NEW`, `IN PROGRESS`, and `DONE` by

   a. On the bottom-left, click the `Settings` gear.
   b. Click `ATTRIBUTES`.
   c. Scroll down to `USER STORY STATUS`.
   d. Hover over `Ready`, click the trash icon to delete and click `ACCEPT`.
   c. Do the same for `Ready for test` and `Archived`.
   d. Click the `KANBAN` icon on the far left. It Looks like columns.

5. In the `NEW` column select `Add New bulk` icon that looks like a list and when the page updates cut-and-paste the lines below into the text box and click `SAVE`.

   ```
   Create the project's backlog
   Create the project in GitLab
   Setup the project
   Author the application
   Align source code with Go coding standards
   Lint your code
   Build the application
   Run your application
   Author the unit tests
   Automate the build (i.e., write the Makefile)
   Author Drone-based Continuous Integration
   ```

Track your progress in [Taiga](https://www.taiga.io/) as you work through each section.

## 11.2. Create the project in GitLab

1. In [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/rluna-gitlab/gitlab-ce) (e.g., <https://gitlab.nemonik.com>), if you need to login the default username is `root` and whatever password you set.
2. Click on `Projects` in the upper left and select `Create blank project` (e.g., <https://gitlab.nemonik.com/projects/new#blank_project>).
3. When the page load, enter `helloworld` for the `Project name`.
4. Provide an optional `Project description`. Something descriptive, such as, `GoLang helloworld application for the hands-on DevOps class.`.
5. [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) the application `Public` to save yourself from entering your username and password when cloning.
6. Click the blue `Create project` button on the lower left.

The UI will refresh to show you a landing page for the project (e.g., <https://gitlab.nemonik.com/root/helloworld>)

## 11.3. Setup the project

On your host open a shell and configure your user name and email:

```bash
git config --global user.name "root"
git config --global user.email "root@nemonik.com"
```

The [Ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible) `golang` playbook will already have configured:

1. Your `$GOPATH` and `$GOBIN` environmental variable.
2. Added `$GOBIN` to your PATH environmental variable.
3. Created `go` workspace in home directory (i.e., `~/go` directory containing `bin`, `pkg`, and `src`.)

Go source code is placed in the `src` directory under a namespace (i.e., a unique base path to avoid naming collisions under which all your go code will reside.) In open source software development, it is typical to use github.com account path. Mine is `github.com/nemonik`, so I would create this base path via (You do the same., so we are all on the same page.)

```bash
mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/nemonik
```

Now lets create the GoLang `helloworld` project to demonstrate Continuous Integration via

```bash
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/nemonik
git clone https://gitlab.nemonik.com/root/helloworld.git
```

Output will resemble

```
Cloning into 'helloworld'...
warning: You appear to have cloned an empty repository.
```

**NOTE**

- Ignore the `warning: You appear to have cloned an empty repository.` warning. This is perfectly normal.

Then move into the clone of your repository via

```bash
cd helloworld
```

So, that you do not version control certain files in git, create a `.gitignore` file with your editor

```bash
nvim .gitignore
```

with the following contents

```
# OS-specific
.DS_Store

# reports
coverage.out
golangci-lint.xml

# binary
./helloworld-web
```

**NOTE**

- [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) sure you pre-pend that dot (`.`) at the start of `.gitignore`. In \*NIX Dot-files are hidden files.
- `.gitignore` will not show up if you simply list the file system via the `ls` command, but if you use `ls -a` or `ls --all` it will. Either arguments configures `ls` to not ignore entries starting with `.`.

## 11.4. Author the application

In the project folder (i.e., `~/go/src/github.com/nemonik/helloworld`) start your module using

```bash
go mod init
```

Whose output will resemble

```
go: creating new go.mod: module github.com/nemonik/helloworld
go: to add module requirements and sums:
	go mod tidy
```

Then create `main.go` in `nvim` with this content:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
  fmt.Println(HelloWorld())
}

func HelloWorld() string {
  return "hello world"
}
```

When you first open the file in `nvim` it will populate the file with

```go
package main

import "fmt"

  func main() {
         fmt.Println("vim-go")
  }
```

Just delete or edit.

## 11.5. Align source code with Go coding standards

`vim-go` will automagically format the source code according to Go coding standards upon saving the file and exiting the editor.

Otherwise, you can format source code in the module by entering into the shell

```bash
go fmt
```

## 11.6. Lint your code

Already installed on your `host` is `golint`. Where `go fmt` reformatted the code to GoLang standards, `golint` prints style mistakes.

To run `golint`, in the root of the `helloworld` project execute

```bash
golint
```

Command line out will be

```
main.go:9:1: exported function HelloWorld should have comment or be unexported
```

Fix the error by editing `main.go` to

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	fmt.Println(HelloWorld())
}

// HelloWorld returns "hello world"
func HelloWorld() string {
	return "hello world"
}
```

Run `golint` again and it should return no output indicating it sees nothing wrong.

## 11.7. Build the application

Build the project by executing

```bash
go build -o helloworld .
```

Success returns no command line output. What? Did you want a cookie? No cookie for you. This is GoLang's way of doing things. Silence is golden and means things went fine. Otherwise, go back and fix the mistakes in your code.

## 11.8. Run your application

Now run your application

```bash
./helloworld
```

The command line output will be

```bash
hello world
```

## 11.9. Author the unit tests

GoLang ships with a built-in `testing` package

<https://golang.org/pkg/testing/>

for automated unit testing of Go packages. Unit testing is a software development process where the smallest testable components of an application are individually tested for proper operation. Unit testing offers the biggest return for dollars spent in comparison to integration and functional testing.

For more on this topic read Martin Fowler's

<https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TestPyramid.html>

but in short unit testing in comparison to integration and functional testing provides the greatest bang for buck followed by integration and functional testing (i.e., unit testing is the cheapest most valuable from of testing.) Functional testing, where the system is tested against the functional requirements, is by far the most expensive, most brittle, and arguably less valuable in comparison.

In `nvim` create `main_test.go` with this content:

```go
package main

import (
	"os"
	"testing"
)

func TestMain(m *testing.M) {
	os.Exit(m.Run())
}

func TestHelloWorld(t *testing.T) {
	if HelloWorld() != "hello world" {
		t.Errorf("got %s expected %s", HelloWorld(), "hello world")
	}
}
```

The test is 16 lines as per

```bash
$ cat main_test.go | wc -l
```

where we pipe the contents of `main_test.go` through the `wc` command-line utility used to display the number of lines, words, and/or bytes in standard input

The `helloworld` application itself is just 12 lines of code as per

```bash
$ cat main.go | wc -l
```

Yes, line count is an overly simple metric to weigh, but line count should serve to inform you of the obvious -- there's a cost in authoring unit tests. This cost is perhaps the number one reason why authoring unit tests will be skipped. Well, that and having the necessary engineering prowess to author them. The same could be said in regards to automation authored in this course. Please, keep this in mind as you work your way through the course material.

Let's execute the unit test by entering

```bash
go test -v -cover
```

The command line returns

```
=== RUN   TestHelloWorld
--- PASS: TestHelloWorld (0.00s)
PASS
coverage: 50.0% of statements
ok  	github.com/nemonik/helloworld	0.003s
```

This step and all the proceeding follows of a DevOps tenant where "Developers are expected to pre-flight new code."

## 11.10. Automate the build (i.e., write the `Makefile`)

Build automation is a key practice of CI. So, let's make the build reproducible by automating everything we've done this far via authoring a [Makefile](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)#Makefile>).

In the root of the project create `Makefile` and add the following contents

```makefile
BINARY_NAME=helloworld

.PHONY: all clean fmt lint test build run

all: build
clean:
	go clean
	rm -f $(BINARY_NAME)
fmt:
	go fmt
lint: fmt
	go get golang.org/x/lint/golint
	golint
test: lint
	go test -v -cover ./...
build: test
	go build -o $(BINARY_NAME) -v
run:
	./$(BINARY_NAME)
```

**NOTE**

- Each line indentation is a `tab` and **not** a series of `space bar` characters. [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) will fail to execute if these tabs are converted to a series of space characters.
- The first letter of the `Makefile` is capitialized.

Save the file and exit your editor.

Okay, let's try out our build automation

```bash
make all
```

The output will resemble

```bash
go fmt
go get golang.org/x/lint/golint
go get: added golang.org/x/lint v0.0.0-20210508222113-6edffad5e616
golint
go test -v -cover ./...
=== RUN   TestHelloWorld
--- PASS: TestHelloWorld (0.00s)
PASS
coverage: 50.0% of statements
ok  	github.com/nemonik/helloworld	0.151s	coverage: 50.0% of statements
go build -o helloworld -v
```

## 11.11. Author Drone-based Continuous Integration

CI integrates all of the steps we have worked to ensure a high quality build into a pipeline, so let's do that.

We're going to author a continuous integration pipeline for our application and execute it on Drone. Drone expects a `.drone.yml` to exist at the root of the project and will execute the pipeline it contains when the project is committed to [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/rluna-gitlab/gitlab-ce).

A pipeline is broken up into multiple named steps, where each step executes in an ephemeral (i.e., does its job and then poof it is gone) container with shared disk access to the project's workspace. The benefit of this approach is that it relieves you from having to create and maintain slaves to execute your pipelines.

Drone automatically clones your project's repo (Short for "repository.") into a volume (referred to as the workspace) shared by each container (including plugin and service containers).

First, let's retrieve the [golang](https://hub.docker.com/_/golang) container image and push into our private containert registry

```bash
docker pull golang:1.16.5
docker tag golang:1.16.5 k3d-registry.nemonik.com:5000/golang:1.16.5
docker push k3d-registry.nemonik.com:5000/golang:1.16.5
```

Then in `nvim` create `.drone.yml` file at the root of the `helloworld` project:

```yaml
kind: pipeline
type: kubernetes
name: default

steps:
  - name: build
    image: k3d-registry.nemonik.com:5000/golang:1.16.5
    commands:
      - make build

  - name: run
    image: k3d-registry.nemonik.com:5000/golang:1.16.5
    commands:
      - make run
```

**NOTE**

- Make sure you pre-pend that dot (`.`) at the start of `.drone.yml`.
- Like the `.gitignore` file, `.drone.yml` is a hidden file and will not show up if you list the directory contents with `ls` alone. You will need to enter `ls -las`.

The pipeline is authored in YAML like almost all the CI orchestrators out there except for Jenkin's Pipelines, which you author in Groovy-based DSL.

- `steps:` - defines the list of steps followed to build, test and deploy your code.
- `build` and `run` - defines the names of the step. These are yours to name. Name steps something meaningful as to what the step is orchestrating. Each step is executed serially, in the order defined.
- `image: k3d-registry.nemonik.com:5000/golang:1.16.5` - defines the container image to execute the step. The golang container tagged `1.16.5` will be retrieved from private container image registry located at `k3d-registry.nemonik.com:5000`. Drone uses Docker images for the build environment, plugins and service containers. Drone spins them up for the execution of the pipeline and when no longer needed they go poof.
- `commands` - defines a collection of terminal commands to be executed. These are all the same commands we executed previously in the command line. If anyone of these commands were to fail returning a non-zero exit code, the pipeline will immediately end resulting in a failed build.

### 11.11.1. Configure Drone to execute your pipeline

1. Open Drone (e.g., <https://drone.nemonik.com>)
2. If this is your first time, you will need to click `CONTINUE` on welcome-page.
3. Your browser will be redirected to [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/rluna-gitlab/gitlab-ce), where if you're not authenticated please provide your credentials. You will be asked to authorize Drone to use your account by clicking the blue `Authorize` button.
4. You will be returned back to [Drone CI](https://github.com/drone/drone) and if you haven't already completed the registeration form be asked to submit your email, full name and company. Provide what you feel comfortable providing and then click `Submit`.
5. Drone will then try to sync with [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/rluna-gitlab/gitlab-ce), so wait for a bit while the syncing arrows chase each other for a bit.
6. Then click `root/helloworld` repo and `ACTIVATE REPOSITORY` to enable [Drone CI](https://github.com/drone/drone) orchestration for the project.
7. Then click the Drone logo in the upper left of the page to return home.

You won't have any builds to start, but when you do the builds will increment starting from 1.

The build colors mean something:

- `Red` - indicates a failed build.
- `Yellow-orange` - is the presently executing build.
- `Green` - is a build that passed.

When a build does start, click on its row to open and monitor it. The UI will update as the build proceeds informing you as to its progress.

### 11.11.2. Trigger the build

To trigger the build, simply commit your code:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "added Drone pipeline"
git push origin master
```

**NOTE**

- Since we have not registered an SSH key with [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/rluna-gitlab/gitlab-ce), during the push we will be prompted to enter a `Username` and `Password`.
- By default your `Username` is `root` and your `Password` is whatever you set for GitLab.
- The git command-line client will not display your password as you enter it.

Immediately after you enter your [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/rluna-gitlab/gitlab-ce) username/password open Drone CI (e.g., <https://drone.nemonik.com/root/helloworld>) in your browser, if you re-use an existing tab to this page refresh the page.

Give it time, but your pipeline should execute.

The execution of this pipeline will follow as so:

1. A new build will appear. Click on it.
2. Drone will clone your project's repository in a `clone` step.
3. And then will execute a `build` and `run` steps in order each spinning up `golang:1.16.5` container.
4. These steps execute the commands in the same way you executed them yourself:
   a. make lint
   b. make test
   c. make build
   d. make run

The output of the `build` (An arbitrary name. You could use "skippy".) step will resemble:

```bash
+ make build
go fmt
go get golang.org/x/lint/golint
go: downloading golang.org/x/lint v0.0.0-20210508222113-6edffad5e616
go: downloading golang.org/x/tools v0.0.0-20200130002326-2f3ba24bd6e7
golint
go test -v -cover ./...
=== RUN   TestHelloWorld
--- PASS: TestHelloWorld (0.00s)
PASS

coverage: 50.0% of statements
ok  	github.com/nemonik/helloworld	0.003s	coverage: 50.0% of statements
go build -o helloworld -v
github.com/nemonik/helloworld
```

The output of the `run` step will resemble:

```bash
+ make run
./helloworld
hello world
```

Our build was successful. [Drone CI](https://github.com/drone/drone) uses a container's exit code to determine success or failure. A container's non-zero exit code will cause the pipeline to exit immediately.

That's it. This is essentially CI. Remember, CI stands for "Continuous Integration". Scintillating isn't it?

**NOTES**

- If your pipeline should fail you can debug via reviewing the

  ```bash
  kubectl logs -n drone -l app.kubernetes.io/component=drone-runner-kube -f
  ```

  Output will look like

  ```
  time="2021-07-17T20:34:27Z" level=warning msg="Engine: Container start timeout" build.id=1 build.number=1 container=drone-sssx70ptd4ctv6uqpucc error="kubernetes error: container failed to start in timely manner: id=drone-sssx70ptd4ctv6uqpucc" image="k3d-registry.nemonik.com:5000/golang:1.16.5" placeholder="drone/placeholder:1" pod=drone-2mvry5w700zvx3z3l2gw repo.id=1 repo.name=helloworld repo.namespace=root stage.id=1 stage.name=default stage.number=1 step=build step.name=build thread=17
  time="2021-07-17T20:43:41Z" level=warning msg="Engine: Container start timeout" build.id=3 build.number=3 container=drone-3akpvbe33pxqhbxrba1a error="kubernetes error: container failed to start in
  ```

- You can also re-run the pipelne for a build in `debug` mode via the [Drone CI](https://github.com/drone/drone) web interface. Click on the hamburger in the upper left (i.e., three dots in a vertical line), select `Debug` and it will re-run the pipeline and then pause at the failed step, so you can open a web-based shell into the running step and debug it. Once, Drone CI gets to the failed step it will provide a `OPEN REMOTE SESSION` button to open you into a shell of the step that failed. Pretty cool.

## 11.12. The completed source for `helloworld`

The `helloworld` project can be viewed completed on GitHub at

<https://github.com/nemonik/helloworld-gen2>

# 12. Golang `helloworld-web` project

Like `helloworld`, the `helloworld-web` project is a very simple application that we will use to explore Continuous Deliver. Remember, Continuous Delivery builds upon Continuous Integration. You've accomplished Continuous Integration. Wahoo.

## 12.1. Create the project's backlog

Open [Taiga](https://www.taiga.io/) in your web browser (e.g., <http://taiga.nemonik.com>).

Complete the follow to track your progress in completing the _helloworld-web_ project

1. Click `Projects` in the upper-left, then `New Project`.
2. Select `Kanban`. A Kanban board shows how work moves from left to right, each column represents a stage within the value stream.
3. Give your project a name. For example, `Helloworld-web` and a description, such as, `My Kanban board for this awesome helloworld-web app` and then click `CREATE PROJECT`.
4. You can skip this step and opt to chose to click `<` to fold `READY`, `USER STORY STATUS` and `ARCHIVED` only after completing step 6. Otherwise, you can edit your Kanban board to just show `NEW`, `IN PROGRESS`, and `DONE` by
   a. On the bottom-left, click the `Settings` gear.
   b. Click `ATTRIBUTES`.
   c. Scroll down to `USER STORY STATUS`.
   d. Hover over `Ready`, click the trash icon to delete and click `ACCEPT`.
   c. Do the same for `Ready for test` and `Archived`.
   d. Click the `KANBAN` icon on the far left. It Looks like columns. And then reload the browser to get the changes to take
5. In the `NEW` column select `Add New bulk` icon that looks like a list and when the page updates cut-and-paste the lines below into the text box and click `SAVE`.

   ```
   Create the project's backlog
   Create the project in GitLab
   Setup the project
   Author the helloworld-web application
   Build and run the helloworld-web application
   Run golangci-lint on the helloworld-web application
   Author the unit tests
   Perform static analysis (i.e., sonar-scanner) on the command line
   Automate the build (i.e., write the Makefile)
   Containerize the application
   Run the container
   Push the container image to the private registry
   Configure Drone to execute your CICD pipeline
   Add Static Analysis (sonar) step to your CICD pipeline
   Add the build step to the pipeline
   Add the nemonik\helloworld-web:latest container image publish step to pipeline
   Deploy helloworld-web application to the Kubernetes cluster
   Add a deploy rule to the Makefile
   Add a deploy step to the pipeline
   Add compliance-as-code (inspec) test to the pipeline
   ```

Track your progress in [Taiga](https://www.taiga.io/) as you work through each section.

## 12.2. Create the project in GitLab

1. In [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/rluna-gitlab/gitlab-ce) (e.g., <https://gitlab.nemonik.com>) click on the [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/rluna-gitlab/gitlab-ce) logo in the upper left.
2. Click `Projects` on the far upper-left and `Click blank project` (e.g. <https://gitlab.nemonik.com/projects/new#blank_project>)
3. Enter `helloworld-web` for the `Project name`. **Be careful with the spelling.**
4. Provide an optional `Project description`. Something descriptive, such as, `GoLang helloworld application for the hands-on DevOps class.`.
5. Save yourself a headache, and make the application `Public`.
6. Click the `Create project` button on the lower left.

The UI will refresh to show you landing page for the project (e.g., <https://gitlab.nemonik.com/root/helloworld-web>).

## 12.3. Setup the project

You'll now clone the new `helloworld-web` [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/rluna-gitlab/gitlab-ce) hosted repo as you did prior for the `helloworld` project.

If you don't already have a shell open, open one now and enter the following

```bash
cd ~/go/src/github.com/nemonik
git clone https://gitlab.nemonik.com/root/helloworld-web.git
cd helloworld-web
```

**NOTE**

- The URL for the project provided above is the default. You will have to adjust it for your configuration.
- Again, ignore the "warning: You appear to have cloned an empty repository." warning, cause of course you did.
- The `git clone` will fail if you did not name your project correctly while in [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/rluna-gitlab/gitlab-ce).

So, that you do not version control certain files in git, create a `.gitignore` file with your editor with this content

```
# OS-specific
.DS_Store

# reports
coverage.out
golangci-lint.xml
inspec_helloworld.json

# binary
./helloworld-web

# sonar
.scannerwork/
```

## 12.4. Author the `helloworld-web` application

In the project folder (i.e., `~/go/src/github.com/nemonik/helloworld`) start your module using

```bash
go mod init
```

Whose output will resemble

```
go: creating new go.mod: module github.com/nemonik/helloworld
go: to add module requirements and sums:
	go mod tidy
```

Then create `main.go` in `nvim` with this content:

```Go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"net/http"
)

func main() {
	http.HandleFunc("/", handler)
	fmt.Print("listening on :3000\n")
	http.ListenAndServe(":3000", logRequest(http.DefaultServeMux))
}

func handler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	fmt.Fprintf(w, "Hello world!\n")
}

func logRequest(handler http.Handler) http.Handler {
	return http.HandlerFunc(func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
		fmt.Printf("%s  %s  %s\n", r.RemoteAddr, r.Method, r.URL)
		handler.ServeHTTP(w, r)
	})
}
```

Format the code like you did previously, but if you are using `nvim` as configured through the class automation the source will already by formatted correctly up save.

```bash
go fmt
```

## 12.5. Build and run the `helloworld-web` application

Build the application

```bash
go build -o helloworld-web .
```

No output means things are peachy. Otherwise fix your mistakes.

Now run

```bash
./helloworld-web
```

Command line output will be

```bash
listening on :3000
```

One OSX, you may be asked to `Allow` “helloworld-web” to accept incoming network connections? Click `Allow`.

To run the application, either

- Open <http://localhost:3000> in a web browser, or
- Enter `curl http://localhost:3000` into the command-line of another terminal.

Both will return:

```
Hello world!
```

`./helloworld-web`'s output in the terminal window will resemble

```
listening on :3000
[::1]:55890  GET  /
```

`crl-c` will stop your application.

## 12.6. Run golangci-lint on the `helloworld-web` application

Okay. So, our code runs, but are there any hidden problems?

In our prior `helloworld ` project we used `golint`, but although `golint` is still a "useful engine" it has been [deprecated/frozen](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/38968) (i.e., no longer maintained) we should look for another linter. Earlier versions of this course used the [Go Meta Linter](https://github.com/alecthomas/gometalinter), but this linter is also deprecated with the advise to use [golangci-lint](https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint), so this is what we'll use. the Like the [Go Meta Linter](https://github.com/alecthomas/gometalinter), [golangci-lint](https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint) provides an extensible list of linters, so we'll have all our bases covered.

The [Ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible) [ansible/go.yaml](./ansible/go.yaml) playbook will have installed `golangci-lint` for you. To install yourself read <https://golangci-lint.run/usage/install/#local-installation>.

Now, let us run our linters.

```bash
golangci-lint run
```

`golangci-lint` with no configuration will run all these linters:

**deadcode**: Finds unused code [fast: false, auto-fix: false]
**errcheck**: Errcheck is a program for checking for unchecked errors in go programs. These unchecked errors can be critical bugs in some cases [fast: false, auto-fix: false]
**gosimple (megacheck)**: Linter for Go source code that specializes in simplifying a code [fast: false, auto-fix: false]
**govet (vet, vetshadow)**: Vet examines Go source code and reports suspicious constructs, such as Printf calls whose arguments do not align with the format string [fast: false, auto-fix: false]
**ineffassign**: Detects when assignments to existing variables are not used [fast: true, auto-fix: false]
**staticcheck (megacheck)**: Staticcheck is a go vet on steroids, applying a ton of static analysis checks [fast: false, auto-fix: false]
**structcheck**: Finds unused struct fields [fast: false, auto-fix: false]
**typecheck**: Like the front-end of a Go compiler, parses and type-checks Go code [fast: false, auto-fix: false]
**unused (megacheck)**: Checks Go code for unused constants, variables, functions and types [fast: false, auto-fix: false]
**varcheck**: Finds unused global variables and constants [fast: false, auto-fix: false]

**NOTE**

- A number of linters are disabled by default. To view these enter `golangci-lint help linters` in your shell.

And after some time, it will output something like the following

```
main.go:11:21: Error return value of `http.ListenAndServe` is not checked (errcheck)
	http.ListenAndServe(":3000", logRequest(http.DefaultServeMux))
```

Oops. Line 11 has problems:

- `http.ListenAndServe(":3000", logRequest(http.DefaultServeMux))` on line 11 returns an `err` if it runs into problems. We need to handle the problem by logging the `err` and exit.

### 12.6.1. Fixing the problem

Let's fix the problems by opening `main.go` in our editor, make the following changes to address the concerns and save

```go
package main

import (
	"log"
	"fmt"
	"net/http"
)

func main() {
	http.HandleFunc("/", handler)
	fmt.Print("listening on :3000\n")
	log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(":3000", logRequest(http.DefaultServeMux)))
}

func handler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	_, err := fmt.Fprintf(w, "Hello world!\n")
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
}

func logRequest(handler http.Handler) http.Handler {
	return http.HandlerFunc(func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
		fmt.Printf("%s  %s  %s\n", r.RemoteAddr, r.Method, r.URL)
		handler.ServeHTTP(w, r)
	})
}
```

`vim-go` will correct our formatting.

And then run our linters again

```bash
golangci-lint run
```

And after some time, nothing is returned. Problem solved. If they could all be this easy.

## 12.7. Author the unit tests

So, our code runs and we've fixed the problems surfaced by our linter.

But like most software written for the government, we don't have any unit tests, so let's fix that.

Create `main_test.go` in `nvim` with this content:

```Go
package main

import (
	"io/ioutil"
	"net/http"
	"net/http/httptest"
	"os"
	"testing"
)

func TestLogRequest(t *testing.T) {

	mux := http.NewServeMux()
	mux.Handle("/", http.HandlerFunc(handler))

	l := logRequest(mux)

	// Create an http request
	req, _ := http.NewRequest("GET", "/", nil)

	// Create  http.ResponseWriter for test inspection
	recorder := httptest.NewRecorder()

	// Capture Stdout
	rescueStdout := os.Stdout
	r, w, _ := os.Pipe()
	os.Stdout = w

	l.ServeHTTP(recorder, req)

	// Stop capturing Stdout
	w.Close()
	out, _ := ioutil.ReadAll(r)
	os.Stdout = rescueStdout

	// Compare

	if string(out) != "  GET  /\n" {
		t.Errorf("logRequest didn't log the expected \"GET  /\"")
	}
}

func TestHandler(t *testing.T) {
	// Create an http request
	req, _ := http.NewRequest("GET", "/", nil)

	// Create  http.ResponseWriter for test inspection
	recorder := httptest.NewRecorder()

	// Call the handler
	handler(recorder, req)

	// Inspect the http.ResponseWriter
	if recorder.Code != http.StatusOK {
		t.Errorf("Server did not return %v", http.StatusOK)
	}

	if recorder.Body.String() != "Hello world!\n" {
		t.Errorf("Body contain \"%v\" instead of expected \"Hello world!\"", recorder.Body.String())
	}
}

func TestMain(m *testing.M) {
	os.Exit(m.Run())
}
```

Wow. That's a lot more code than the application itself, huh. Maybe this is the reason so few unit tests are written.

Execute the unit test by entering

```bash
go test -v -cover
```

The command line will return something like

```
=== RUN   TestLogRequest
--- PASS: TestLogRequest (0.00s)
=== RUN   TestHandler
--- PASS: TestHandler (0.00s)
PASS
coverage: 55.6% of statements
ok  	github.com/nemonik/helloworld-web	1.044s
```

Notice, we only scored 55.6% coverage, but we appear to have a unit test for all our methods? This where discernment comes in. Do you battle for a 100%, 80%, some other number snatched from the air or call this a win. Up to you or really your team.

## 12.8. Perform static analysis (i.e., sonar-scanner) on the command line

[SonarQube](https://github.com/SonarSource/sonarqube/) provides a static analysis capability to show the health of an application's source code, highlighting issues as they are introduced.

### 12.8.1. Perform static analysis on the command line

Before you run sonar-scanner you have to commit your code so Sonar knows who to blame, so first head back to your `development` shell and enter

```bash
git add main.go main_test.go
git commit -m "added application code and unit test"
```

In `nvim` create a `sonar-project.properties` file

```
sonar.host.url=https://sonar.nemonik.com
sonar.projectKey=helloworld-web
sonar.projectName=helloworld-web
sonar.projectVersion=1.0
sonar.go.golangci-lint.reportPaths=tests/reports/golangci-lint.xml
sonar.go.coverage.reportPaths=tests/reports/coverage.out
sonar.sources=./
sonar.tests=./
sonar.test.inclusions=**/**_test.go
sonar.sources.inclusions=**/**.go
```

Then start the analysis with

```bash
go fmt
mkdir -p tests/reports && touch tests/reports/.gitkeep
golangci-lint run --out-format checkstyle | tee tests/reports/golangci-lint.xml
go test ./... -coverprofile=tests/reports/coverage.out
sonar-scanner
```

After some time, the output will look like

[![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/EAtxEFtnTyddjJvui6PCnchPt.svg)](https://asciinema.org/a/EAtxEFtnTyddjJvui6PCnchPt)

**NOTE**

- If you see an error concerned about blame files not being found you didn't first commit your code. Go back commit your code. You don't need to `push` it. Just commit it. Commit it!!!!
- Also, notice I didn't say `push` your code. Your code hasn't been pushed to [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/rluna-gitlab/gitlab-ce), but has only been committed to your local copy of your repository.

Let me unpack what the above commands are doing

`go fmt` formats the code as we did earlier.

`golangci-lint run --out-format checkstyle | tee tests/reports/golangci-lint.xml` gathers golangci-lint reports in checkstyle format

`go test ./... -coverprofile=tests/reports/coverage.out` executes your unit tests and generate the `coverage.out` report.

`sonar-scanner` then submits the reports. [SonarQube](https://github.com/SonarSource/sonarqube/) will automatically create the project for you with a report (e.g., <https://sonar.nemonik.com/dashboard?id=helloworld-web>).

## 12.9. Automate the build (i.e., write the Makefile)

In `nvim` create a `Makefile` to ensure the build and the steps leading to are repeatable.

```makefile
BINARY_NAME=helloworld-web

.PHONY: all clean fmt lint test sonar build run

all: sonar build
clean:
	go clean
	rm -f $(BINARY_NAME)
	rm -f tests/reports/golangci-lint.xml
	rm -f tests/reports/coverage.out
fmt:
	go fmt
lint: fmt
	mkdir -p tests/reports && touch tests/reports/.gitkeep
	golangci-lint run --out-format checkstyle | tee tests/reports/golangci-lint.xml
test: lint
	mkdir -p tests/reports && touch tests/reports/.gitkeep
	go test ./... -coverprofile=tests/reports/coverage.out
sonar: test
	sonar-scanner
build:
	go build -o $(BINARY_NAME) -v
run:
	./$(BINARY_NAME)
```

**NOTE**

- The indents are `tab` characters and not `spaces` characters otherwise your `make` will fail to execute. The `nvim` editor will recognize your file is a [Makefile](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)#Makefile> and warn you incorrect indentation.

Test out your `Makefile`

```bash
make all
```

Output will resemble

```
go fmt
mkdir -p tests/reports && touch tests/reports/.gitkeep
golangci-lint run --out-format checkstyle | tee tests/reports/golangci-lint.xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

## 12.10. Containerize the application

We can build a Docker image for our application on top of a `golang:1.16.5` container image we earlier pushed into our private container registry by creating a `Dockerfile` with the following content

```docker
FROM k3d-registry.nemonik.com:5000/golang:1.16.5
MAINTAINER Michael Joseph Walsh <nemonik@gmail.com>

RUN mkdir /app
ADD helloworld-web /app/

WORKDIR /app

ENTRYPOINT ["/app/helloworld-web"]

EXPOSE 3000
```

And then build the application and create its Docker image via

```bash
make build
docker build -t nemonik/helloworld-web .
```

**NOTE**

- Don't miss that last period (`.`) at the end the line above.
- If you get an error message like `failed to solve with frontend dockerfile.v0: failed to read dockerfile: open /var/lib/docker/tmp/buildkit-mount305186654/Dockerfile: no such file or directory` you've misspelled `Dockerfile` or simply didn't create it.

After some time, the command line output will resemble

```

 => => naming to docker.io/nemonik/helloworld-web
```

What just happened?

- The `FROM` line instructs Docker to retrieve the `golang:1.16.5` from the private container image registry running on Docker, which it did. And then use this as the basis of your application's docker image.
- Then the rest of the commands in the `Dockerfile` are executed laying down layers on top of the `golang:1.16.5` container image thereby building a new docker image entitled `nemonik/helloworld-web` and tagging it `latest`.
- `docker build` then places the image with the name `nemonik/helloworld-web` in your host's local container image registry so that containers can be created off this image locally.

Check the development vagrant's local container image registry via

```bash
docker images nemonik/helloworld-web
```

The command line output will resemble

```
REPOSITORY               TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED         SIZE
nemonik/helloworld-web   latest    15b253f9c34c   5 minutes ago   868MB
```

You've created an approximately 868MB sized `nemonik/helloworld-web` image tagged `latest`. Kind of fat isn't? Not "phat" as in cool, but fat as in large.

**NOTE:**

- The registry will also contain the `k3d-registry.nemonik.com:5000/golang:1.16.5` on which `nemonik/helloworld-web:latest` is based, so the next time re-build image you won't have to wait for `k3d-registry.nemonik.com:5000/golang:1.16.5` to be retrieved.

But this approach doesn't create the smallest most secure container image. You can accomplish this by instead using Docker's reserved, minimal image `scratch`, as a starting point for your `Dockerfile` like so

```docker
FROM scratch
MAINTAINER Michael Joseph Walsh <nemonik@gmail.com>

WORKDIR /

ADD helloworld-web /

ENTRYPOINT ["/helloworld-web"]

EXPOSE 3000
```

In order for our Go application to execute in the smallest container image possible we will disable cgo tool that is enabled by default for cross compiling, target the Linux operating system and build our Go application statically to include all the dependencies like so

```bash
CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux go build -a -o helloworld-web .
```

**NOTE:**

- `-a` parameter is used to force rebuilding package to ensure you have all the dependencies.

We can update the project's [Makefile](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)#Makefile>) to do the same by

```bash
nvim Makefile
```

Update the top of the Makefile to be

```makefile
.PHONY: all clean fmt lint test sonar build run docker-build

all: sonar docker-build
```

Then modifying the `build` rule

```makefile
build:
	CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux go build -o $(BINARY_NAME) -v
```

And add the `docker-build` target to the end

```makefile
docker-build: build
	docker build --no-cache -t nemonik/helloworld-web .
```

Remember to use `tab` characters vice `space` characters.

And then run in the command line

```bash
make docker-build
```

Whose output will resemble

[![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/qdrRrFhtIhUHpp0UuwItUcIqV.svg)](https://asciinema.org/a/qdrRrFhtIhUHpp0UuwItUcIqV)

Execute the `docker images` command again for this new image

```bash
docker images nemonik/helloworld-web
```

And its output will resemble

```
REPOSITORY               TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED         SIZE
nemonik/helloworld-web   latest    2a95b88aaa45   4 minutes ago   6.14MB
```

The image is a slim 6.14 MB and way more secure.

## 12.11. Run the container

Spin up a new `nemonik/helloworld-web` container by entering either

- Option 1 - Run the container in the foreground

  ```bash
  docker run -p 3000:3000 --name helloworld-web  nemonik/helloworld-web
  ```

  and then hitting

  <http://localhost:3000>

  in your web browser, or

- Option 2 - Run the container in the background

  ```
  docker run -d -p 3000:3000 --name helloworld-web nemonik/helloworld-web
  ```

  The command will output a string of text resembling

  ```
  82df2a483612c923c1c6e1ee0f08fdf24dca8f0db66c3fc7ec483e5796c53cc5
  ```

  This is the container id for the container you just spun up.

  Now hit the same URL in the command-line via

  ```bash
  curl http://localhost:3000
  ```

Where

- `run` messages Docker you are running a new container
- `-d` in the second option, runs the container in background and prints container ID.
- `-p 3000:3000` published the container's port as 3000 to the host.
- `--name helloworld-web` names the running container
- `nemonik/helloworld-web` states what container image to use.

### 12.11.1. Option 1

The command line output for the first option will be

```
Listening on :3000
172.17.0.1:60178  GET  /
```

### 12.11.2. Option 2

For the second option there will be no output written to the screen, but you can see the same output if you run

```bash
docker logs <the container id output when started the container> -f
```

or

```bash
docker logs helloworld-web  -f
```

returning

```
listening on :3000
172.17.0.1:61714  GET  /
```

`ctrl-c` (i.e., press and hold the `ctrl` key while pressing `c`) to exit the logs.

To kill the container

```bash
docker rm -f helloworld-web
```

## 12.12. Push the container image to the private registry

In the development vagrant, push the `nemonik/helloworld-web` container image into the private container registry running in the [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/what-is-kubernetes/) cluster, so that all the vagrants can create containers from the image with the commands

```bash
docker tag nemonik/helloworld-web k3d-registry.nemonik.com:5000/nemonik/helloworld-web
docker push k3d-registry.nemonik.com:5000/nemonik/helloworld-web
```

Command line output will be

```
Using default tag: latest
The push refers to repository [k3d-registry.nemonik.com:5000/nemonik/helloworld-web]
c55ef32b361b: Pushed
latest: digest: sha256:4306742c9211c49fc7363ba859ec921ff29292aca4678aa15b2fe7f67885fcba size: 528
```

Update the project's `Makefile`

```bash
nvim Makefile
```

Update `.PHONY` and replace `docker-build` with `docker-push` in the `all` target line like so:

```makefile
.PHONY: all clean fmt lint test sonar build run docker-build docker-push

all: sonar docker-push
```

Below `docker-build` insert `docker-push` rule

```makefile
docker-push: docker-build
	docker tag nemonik/helloworld-web k3d-registry.nemonik.com:5000/nemonik/helloworld-web
	docker push k3d-registry.nemonik.com:5000/nemonik/helloworld-web
```

And then run in the command line

```bash
make docker-push
```

The output will be something like

[![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/UBSDv2sI83klwFhbZIotIcJpH.svg)](https://asciinema.org/a/UBSDv2sI83klwFhbZIotIcJpH)

The container registry image shipped by Docker does not provide a GUI, but we can verify by querying the catalog of the private registry through a web browser or [Unix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix) command line tool `curl` by entering into the command line

```bash
curl -X GET http://k3d-registry.nemonik.com:5000/v2/_catalog
```

Returns in the command line

```json
{
  "repositories": [
    "bitnami/postgresql",
    "busybox",
    "drone/drone-runner-kube",
    "drone/kubernetes-secrets",
    "mitre/heimdall2",
    "nemonik/drone",
    "nemonik/helloworld-web",
    "nginx",
    "plantuml/plantuml-server",
    "postgres",
    "rabbitmq",
    "redis",
    "sameersbn/gitlab",
    "sameersbn/postgresql",
    "sonarqube",
    "taigaio/taiga-back",
    "taigaio/taiga-events",
    "taigaio/taiga-front",
    "taigaio/taiga-protected",
    "traefik"
  ]
}
```

The pretty print form of this looks like so

```bash
curl -s -X GET curl -X GET http://k3d-registry.nemonik.com:5000/v2/_catalog | npx prettier --parser json
```

```json
{
  "repositories": [
    "bitnami/postgresql",
    "busybox",
    "drone/drone-runner-kube",
    "drone/kubernetes-secrets",
    "golang",
    "mitre/heimdall2",
    "nemonik/drone",
    "nemonik/helloworld-web",
    "nginx",
    "plantuml/plantuml-server",
    "postgres",
    "rabbitmq",
    "redis",
    "sameersbn/gitlab",
    "sameersbn/postgresql",
    "sonarqube",
    "taigaio/taiga-back",
    "taigaio/taiga-events",
    "taigaio/taiga-front",
    "taigaio/taiga-protected",
    "traefik"
  ]
}
```

`npx` will auto install `prettier` for you.

Quite a bit of container images we got there.

To list container images the private registry holds for the `helloworld-web` container image enter

```bash
curl -X GET http://k3d-registry.nemonik.com:5000/v2/nemonik/helloworld-web/tags/list
```

Returns in the command line

```json
{ "name": "nemonik/helloworld-web", "tags": ["latest"] }
```

The pretty print of this look like

```json
{
  "name": "nemonik/helloworld-web",
  "tags": ["latest"]
}
```

## 12.13. Configure Drone to execute your CICD pipeline

As you did for the purpose of CI (Continuous Integration) of the prior application, you will need to configure Drone to perform CICD (a combination of Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery) on the `helloworld-web` application.

Complete the following:

1. Open [Drone CI](https://github.com/drone/drone) (.e.g., <http://drone.nemonik.com/>) in your browser and authenticate thr:Wqough [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/rluna-gitlab/gitlab-ce) on into Drone, if you need to.
2. Then select `SYNC` and watch as the arrows chase each other for a bit before the `root/helloworld-web` repository shows up.
3. Then click `root/helloworld-web` repo and `ACTIVATE REPOSITORY` to enable Drone orchestration for the project.
4. Then click the Drone logo in the upper left of the page to return home.

## 12.14. Add Static Analysis (`sonar`) step to your CICD pipeline

So, lets create our pipeline starting with a `sonarqube` step to update [SonarQube](https://github.com/SonarSource/sonarqube/) with code quality scans automatically.

We'll need to build a container image to do this

```bash
cd $HOME/Development/workspace
mkdir -p golang-sonarqube-scanner
cd golang-sonarqube-scanner
git init --initial-branch=master
```

Then create `Dockerfile` in `nvim`.

```

ENV PATH /usr/local/sonar-scanner-4.6.2.2472-linux/bin:$PATH

ENTRYPOINT ["kubectl"]

CMD ["--help"]
```

We then build, tag and push this container image into our local registry for use in a pipeline

```bash
docker build -t nemonik/golang-sonarqube-scanner:latest .
docker tag nemonik/golang-sonarqube-scanner:latest k3d-registry.nemonik.com:5000/nemonik/golang-sonarqube-scanner:latest
docker push k3d-registry.nemonik.com:5000/nemonik/golang-sonarqube-scanner:latest
```

The output will resemble

[![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/KSjRi7tBhsdajrBINIYbmbwJG.svg)](https://asciinema.org/a/KSjRi7tBhsdajrBINIYbmbwJG)

Now that we've built, tagged and pushed the container into our registery we can utiulize it in a pipeline.

In the shell

```bash
cd ~/go/src/github.com/nemonik/helloworld-web
nvim .drone.yml
```

copy the content below to create our pipeline (`.drone.yml`) in our text editor

```yaml
kind: pipeline
type: kubernetes
name: default

steps:
  - name: sonarqube
    image: k3d-registry.nemonik.com:5000/nemonik/golang-sonarqube-scanner:latest
    commands:
      - export DRONESRC=`pwd`
      - export GOBIN=$GOPATH/bin
      - export PATH="$GOBIN:$PATH"
      - mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/nemonik
      - cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/nemonik
      - ln -s $DRONESRC helloworld-web
      - cd helloworld-web
      - golangci-lint run --out-format checkstyle > tests/reports/golangci-lint.xml || true
      - go test -v ./... -coverprofile=tests/reports/coverage.out || true
      - sonar-scanner || true
```

Things to note in the above

- This step uses the `nemonik/golang-sonarqube-scanner:latest` container image built on top of the `golang:1.16.5` image to speed builds along.
- The following commands is a bit of filesystem juggling, so that the scan can be executed

  ```yaml
  - export DRONESRC=`pwd`
  - export GOBIN=$GOPATH/bin
  - export PATH="$GOBIN:$PATH"
  - mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/nemonik
  - cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/nemonik
  - ln -s $DRONESRC helloworld-web
  ```

  What follows handles running the scan absorbing errors as they arise, so as to not break the build.

  ```yaml
  - cd helloworld-web
  - golangci-lint run --out-format checkstyle > golangci-lint.xml || true
  - go test -v ./... -coverprofile=coverage.out || true
  - sonar-scanner || true
  ```

To execute your pipeline, push your changes to [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/rluna-gitlab/gitlab-ce)

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "added sonar step to pipeline"
git push origin master
```

And then monitor the progress of the `root/helloworld-web` repository build (e.g., <https://drone.nemonik.com/root/helloworld-web> ) in [Drone CI](https://github.com/drone/drone).

The pipeline should execute in a few minutes.

Success typically resembles

## 12.15. Add the `build` step to the pipeline

Add a build step to our `.drone.yml`

```yaml
- name: build
  image: k3d-registry.nemonik.com:5000/golang:1.16.5
  commands:
    - make build
```

To execute your pipeline, push your changes to [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/rluna-gitlab/gitlab-ce)

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "added build step to pipeline"

## 12.16. Add the `nemonik\helloworld-web:latest` container image `publish` step to pipeline

Add the publish step to your `.drone.yml` to the root of the project (e.g., `~/go/src/github.com/nemonik/helloworld-web`), so that the container image is publish to the private registry via the pipeline. The `publish:` step must be indented the same as the prior `build:` step.

```yaml
- name: publish
  image: plugins/docker
  settings:
    storage_driver: overlay
    insecure: true
    registry: k3d-registry.nemonik.com:5000
    repo: k3d-registry.nemonik.com:5000/nemonik/helloworld-web
    force_tag: true
    tags:
      - latest
```

This step makes use of `plugins/docker` container to publish the `nemonik/helloworld-web:latest` container image to the private registry.

To execute your pipeline, push your changes to [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/rluna-gitlab/gitlab-ce)

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "added publish step to pipeline"
git push origin master
```

The publish step will resemble:

```

Indicating the `publish` step executed, successfully.

This step is typically painfully slow if your container isn't optimized suchs as ours as this step leverages docker-in-docker to perform its tasks.

## 12.17. Deploy `helloworld-web` application to the Kubernetes cluster

Let's deploy the `helloworld-web` to the cluster. First we need to author the necessary [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/what-is-kubernetes/) resource files to declare the desired state of the application on the cluster.

[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/what-is-kubernetes/) accomplishes this declaratively through the creating or applying of [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/what-is-kubernetes/) resource files.

In your shell

```bash
cd ~/go/src/github.com/nemonik/helloworld-web`
mkdir kubernetes
cd kubernetes
nvim helloworld-web-namespace.yml
```

and add the following [YAML](https://yaml.org/content) content

```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: helloworld-web
```

And another file, `helloworld-web.yml` with this content

```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/component: helloworld-web
    app.kubernetes.io/instance: helloworld-web
    app.kubernetes.io/name: helloworld-web
  name: helloworld-web
  namespace: helloworld-web
spec:
  ports:
    - name: http
      port: 80
      protocol: TCP
      targetPort: http
  selector:
    app.kubernetes.io/component: helloworld-web
    app.kubernetes.io/instance: helloworld-web
    app.kubernetes.io/name: helloworld-web
  sessionAffinity: None
  type: ClusterIP

---

    app.kubernetes.io/name: helloworld-web
spec:

  selector:
    matchLabels:

      labels:
        app.kubernetes.io/component: helloworld-web
        app.kubernetes.io/instance: helloworld-web
        app.kubernetes.io/name: helloworld-web
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: helloworld-web
          image: "k3d-registry.nemonik.com:5000/nemonik/helloworld-web:latest"
          imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
          ports:
            - name: http
              containerPort: 3000
              protocol: TCP
          livenessProbe:
            httpGet:
              path: /
              port: http
      restartPolicy: Always

apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  annotations:
    traefik.ingress.kubernetes.io/router.entrypoints: websecure
    traefik.ingress.kubernetes.io/router.tls: "true"
  name: helloworld-web
  namespace: helloworld-web
spec:
  rules:
    - host: helloworld.nemonik.com
      http:
        paths:
          - backend:
              service:
                name: helloworld-web
                port:
                  name: http
            path: /
            pathType: Prefix
```

The two [YAML](https://yaml.org/) files describes the `Namespace`, `Service`, `Deployment` and `Ingress` where

- [`Namepace`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/) provide a scope for other Kubernetes resources.
- [`Service`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/) is a REST object that exposes an application running on a set of [Pods](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/) as a network service.
- [`Deployment`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/) deploys your [Pods](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/) declaratively.
- [`Ingress`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/) is an API object the controls external access to the Service.

**NOTES**

- [YAML](https://yaml.org/) files typically usually follow a naming convention where they end in either `.yaml` or `.yml`. Pay close attention to what you type. The class utilizes `.yml` where I find myself favoring through muscle memory to type `.yaml`.

Executing

```bash
kubectl apply -f helloworld-web-namespace.yml 2> /dev/null
kubectl delete -f helloworld-web.yml 2> /dev/null
kubectl apply -f helloworld-web.yml
kubectl wait --for=condition=ready pod -n helloworld-web -l app.kubernetes.io/component=helloworld-web
```

Will deploy the `helloworld-web` application with the following output

```
namespace/helloworld-web created
service/helloworld-web created
deployment.apps/helloworld-web created
ingress.networking.k8s.io/helloworld-web created
pod/helloworld-web-6785bbf496-l92qr condition met
```

Then in a browser open

<https://helloworld.nemonik.com>

or in your shell enter

```bash
curl https://helloworld.nemonik.com
```

Either your deployment will return

```
Hello world!
```

## 12.18. Add a `deploy` rule to the Makefile

Let's add a deploy rule to our `Makefile`

```bash
cd ~/go/src/github.com/nemonik/helloworld-web
nvim Makefile
```

Update the `.PHONY ` and `all` rule to

```Makefile
.PHONY: all clean fmt lint test sonar build run docker-build docker-push deploy

all: sonar deploy
```

Then add to the and of the `Makefile`

```makefile
deploy: docker-push
	kubectl apply -f kubernetes/helloworld-web-namespace.yml 2> /dev/null
	kubectl delete -f kubernetes/helloworld-web.yml 2> /dev/null
	kubectl apply -f kubernetes/helloworld-web.yml
	kubectl wait --for=condition=ready pod -n helloworld-web -l app.kubernetes.io/component=helloworld-web --timeout=180s
```

Execute the make deploy

```bash
make deploy
```

Output will resemble

[![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/GKe2ARz7o1MFIHZnHhXgTj1P8.svg)](https://asciinema.org/a/GKe2ARz7o1MFIHZnHhXgTj1P8)

## 12.19. Add a `deploy` step to the pipeline

Adding a `deploy` step to our Drone pipeline to perform the deployment of `nemonik/helloworld:latest` container image is a bit more involved.

### 12.19.1. Add a Kubernetes service account for the automation

First, we need to create a service account so that we can automate the deployment.

In your shell

```bash
cd ~/go/src/github.com/nemonik/helloworld-web/kubernetes
nvim helloworld-web-service-account.yml
```

create a file with the the following content

```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: helloworld-web-service-account
  namespace: helloworld-web

---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: helloworld-web-admin
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: cluster-admin
subjects:
  - kind: ServiceAccount
    name: helloworld-web-service-account
    namespace: helloworld-web

---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  name: helloworld-web-role
  namespace: helloworld-web
rules:
  - apiGroups: ["*"]
    resources: ["*"]
    verbs: ["*"]

---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: helloworld-web-rolebinding
  namespace: helloworld-web
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: Role
  name: helloworld-web-role
subjects:
  - namespace: helloworld-web
    kind: ServiceAccount
    name: helloworld-web-service-account
```

Then apply the the [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/what-is-kubernetes/) resources to the cluster by

```bash
 kubectl apply -f helloworld-web-service-account.yml
```

Success is rather anticlimactic, but will resemble

```
serviceaccount/helloworld-web-service-account created
clusterrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/helloworld-web-admin created
role.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/helloworld-web-role created
rolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/helloworld-web-rolebinding created
```

But we're not done. More still to do...

**NOTE**

- In this case we created out service account in the namespace of our application. If you delete this namespace, you delete the service account... And invalidate the secrets you create in [Drone CI](https://github.com/drone/drone) in the following step.

### 12.19.2. Add secrets to our `helloworld-web` Drone CI repository

In order to deploy from our pipeline we will need to add a few secrets to our pipeline to utilize our service account.

To start, we need to get the helloworld-web service account token

```fish
set helloworld_web_service_account_token (kubectl get serviceaccount -n helloworld-web --context k3d-hands-on-devops-class helloworld-web-service-account -o jsonpath='{.secrets[0].name}')
kubectl get secret $helloworld_web_service_account_token --context k3d-hands-on-devops-class -n helloworld-web -o jsonpath='{.data.token}' | base64 -d
```

The above is what one would do in the [fish](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell) shell. If you decided to stick with a shell that you were more familiar with like [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) or [Zsh](https://www.zsh.org/) the following is what you are looking for

```bash
helloworld_web_service_account_token=`kubectl get serviceaccount -n helloworld-web --context k3d-hands-on-devops-class helloworld-web-service-account -o jsonpath='{.secrets[0].name}'`
kubectl get secret $helloworld_web_service_account_token --context k3d-hands-on-devops-class -n helloworld-web -o jsonpath='{.data.token}' | base64 -d
```

The result returned will be the `k8s_token` that resembles

```
eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6Im8wX1JsMUZnSXNnUmY5X1lsSk5KcGh6TWN5S1MxTUJVVUsxNWI0VHgzaWMifQ.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.GvyRkXOejhakwDF18ZuaTQt2lmwGvEPqDlJ0uubAov34d7XrCyAWujluPKtn1D4C-teQWuTuV52u2Xu3CyvYU3fU3ztz-k8rwA6rM77fPzdhk0yZ1tnkcZG6i_Kcv0p4_B0RAg9MQYz70S_XFYJhjp8-aqRjXuJ76-hfyWxECvghjehXX5tsT19kgPE9QXBotRQlfvWqOVEsE_hlOnjJUI3CKvm-T2faVCgiK00P6osDtjtVGbvHd4oAO1s9iK8aXOFBuxhcFOfTowRsESMcriMHT7enuTcpaaZ-TE55kJFz3LUnH4PCF0Nn4By77KcrJL1ngJTQr2wyMy-jhr0tAA
```

Then no matter what shell you are using (e.g., [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/), [Zsh](https://www.zsh.org/), [fish](https://fishshell.com/) retrieve the `k8s_cert` by

```bash
kubectl get secret $helloworld_web_service_account_token --context k3d-hands-on-devops-class -n helloworld-web -o jsonpath='{.data.ca\.crt}'
```

2. Click on `Secrets` on the left-hand side.
3. Click `+ NEW SECRET` and in the `Create a New Secret` pop-up enter `k8s_cert` and enter your value above. In the case above I would enter

### 12.19.3. Build, tag and push our `deploy` step container

To deploy our helloworld-web application to our cluster we will use a container. [Sinlead](https://github.com/sinlead) provides a Drone plug (i.e., a container) to do this [sinlead
/drone-kubectl](https://github.com/sinlead/drone-kubectl) that I've patched his plugin to to build from the latest [bitnami/kubectl:1.21.1](https://hub.docker.com/layers/bitnami/kubectl/1.21.1/images/sha256-68feabfc5feff01d246de2298464eeca3a0f339434655715731ca4a0099817ef?context=explore) container image and direct its initialization output to `/dev/null`, so that this unexpected output doesn't break the build.

So, let's retrieve my [fork](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(software_development)>) (i.e., when a developer clones a project and starts independent development on it).

Let's changes directories in the shell

```bash
cd $HOME/Development/workspace
git clone https://github.com/nemonik/drone-kubectl.git
cd drone-kubectl
```

It is always a good idea to inspect the Dockerfile by

```bash
cat Dockerfile
```

Whose output will resemble

```Dockerfile
FROM bitnami/kubectl:1.21.1

LABEL maintainer "Michael Joseph Walsh <github.com@nemonik.com>"
LABEL base-on-the-work-of "Sinlead <opensource@sinlead.com>"

COPY init-kubectl kubectl /opt/sinlead/kubectl/bin/

USER root

ENV PATH="/opt/sinlead/kubectl/bin:$PATH"

ENTRYPOINT ["kubectl"]

CMD ["--help"]
```

Sinlead wraps the [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/overview/) with a bash script so it can access the secrets we've set for our pipeline, so it also a good idea to review [init-kubectl](https://github.com/nemonik/drone-kubectl/blob/master/init-kubectl) and [kubectl](https://github.com/nemonik/drone-kubectl/blob/master/kubectl) copied into `/opt/sinlead/kubectl/bin/`. I've made some slight changes in my fork his work.

We're going to build this container

```bash
docker build -t nemonik/drone-kubectl:1.21.1 .
```

Then tag it and add it to our private container registry

```bash
docker tag nemonik/drone-kubectl:1.21.1 k3d-registry.nemonik.com:5000/nemonik/drone-kubectl:1.21.1
docker push k3d-registry.nemonik.com:5000/nemonik/drone-kubectl:1.21.1
```

### 12.19.4. Add the `deploy` step to our pipeline

Now that service account created, the secrets have been added and we have our container image we'll use to automate the `kubectl` command let's create the `deployment` step.

Now let add a step to our pipeline to deploy our helloworld-web application to our [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/what-is-kubernetes/) cluster

```bash
cd ~/go/src/github.com/nemonik/helloworld-web/
nvim .drone.yml
```

And add the following step at the bottom

```yaml
- name: deploy
  image: k3d-registry.nemonik.com:5000/nemonik/drone-kubectl:1.21.1
  settings:
    kubernetes_cert:
      from_secret: k8s_cert
    kubernetes_token:
      from_secret: k8s_token
  commands:
    - kubectl delete -f kubernetes/helloworld-web.yml 2> /dev/null
    - kubectl apply -f kubernetes/helloworld-web.yml
```

To execute your pipeline, push your changes to [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/rluna-gitlab/gitlab-ce)

```bash
git add .drone.yml
git commit -m "added deploy step to pipeline"
git push origin master
```

Open the `root/helloworld-web` repository pipeline (e.g., https://drone.nemonik.com/root/helloworld-web) in [Drone CI](https://github.com/drone/drone) to monitor.

The pipeline should complete in a few minutes.

The `deployment` step output will resemble

```
+ kubectl delete -f kubernetes/helloworld-web.yml 2> /dev/null
service "helloworld-web" deleted
deployment.apps "helloworld-web" deleted
ingress.networking.k8s.io "helloworld-web" deleted
+ kubectl apply -f kubernetes/helloworld-web.yml
service/helloworld-web created
deployment.apps/helloworld-web created
ingress.networking.k8s.io/helloworld-web created
+ kubectl wait --for=condition=ready pod -n helloworld-web -l app.kubernetes.io/component=helloworld-web
pod/helloworld-web-6785bbf496-qb45b condition met
pod/helloworld-web-6785bbf496-jhg8v condition met

```

Then in a browser open

<https://helloworld.nemonik.com>

or in your shell enter

```bash
curl https://helloworld.nemonik.com
```

Either your deployment will return

```
Hello world!
```

So, now we have beginnings of a real CICD pipeline. There are no strings on me err. you.

**NOTES**

- If your `deploy` step fails with `default: deploy - Error` you likely skipped building, tagging and pushing the `nemonik/drone-kubectl:1.21.1` container image in the prior step. You can debug by looking at the `drone-runner-kube` logs. This pod is used to run your pipelne.

  ```bash
  kubectl logs -n drone -l app.kubernetes.io/component=drone-runner-kube
  ```

  Look for something like

  ```
  time="2021-07-17T21:55:09Z" level=warning msg="Engine: Container start timeout" build.id=4 build.number=4 container=drone-1do79imnrgsthw59fm21 error="kubernetes error: container failed to start in timely manner: id=drone-1do79imnrgsthw59fm21" image="k3d-registry.nemonik.com:5000/nemonik/drone-kubectl:1.21.1" placeholder="drone/placeholder:1" pod=drone-l3ejd197yd9sghsaqxbp repo.id=1 repo.name=helloworld-web repo.namespace=root stage.id=4 stage.name=default stage.number=1 step=deploy step.name=deploy thread=54
  ```

  near the end as an indication.

- You can also rerun your pipeline in debug. In your build you click on the hamburger (three dots in vertical row) found in the upper right-side of the page, click and select `Debug` from the drop down. Your pipeline will re-run up to it fails and then pause until you open shell into the running container to debug by clicking `OPEN REMOTE SESSION` on the lower-right side of the page. You may have to add executables to your PATH, etc, but you can debug the step to your heart's content.

## 12.20. Add compliance-as-code (`inspec`) test to the pipeline

First let me switch gears into discussing DevSecOps.

The _Dev_ part of the _DevOps_ clip for _development_ (i.e., the application developers) and _Ops_ clip for; well, "every technology operational stakeholder (e.g., network engineers administrators, testers, and why yes, security engineers.)" _DevSecOps_ is a specialization of DevOps focused on embedding security thought and collaboration into your team's culture when working an applications software development life cycle (SDLC) often expressed as _security-as-code_. If you're doing DevOps correctly, you're also inherently performing the methods and repeated practices of DevSecOps. In DevOps, every technology operational stakeholder discipline must be included in the team without needing to fork DevOps to include said discipline. We don't need _DevNetOps_ nor do we need _DevTestOps_ nor we need _DevShempOps_...

So, let us add some _security-as-code_ to our project.

Authoring [InSpec](https://github.com/inspec/inspec) tests permit you to author compliance-as-code, a form of security-as-code, thereby turning compliance, security, and other policy requirements into automated tests.

[InSpec](https://github.com/inspec/inspec) has a very robust support for both the container and its host, see: https://lollyrock.com/posts/inspec-for-docker/ for more information for using InSpec with Docker.

More on [InSpec](https://github.com/inspec/inspec) in general can be found here

https://www.inspec.io/docs/

And these specific sections are relevant to Docker:

https://www.inspec.io/docs/reference/resources/docker_container/

https://www.inspec.io/docs/reference/resources/docker/

https://www.inspec.io/docs/reference/resources/docker_image/

A really good tutorial focused on InSpec can be found here:

<http://www.anniehedgie.com/inspec-basics-1>

### 12.20.1. Author our InSpec tests

Back in your shell at the root of the `helloworld-web` project (i.e., `~/go/src/github.com/nemonik/helloworld-web`), we'll initialize an [InSpec](https://github.com/inspec/inspec) profile to verify your container's compliance to policy and configuration guidance. Yep, you're "gonna" be a security engineer.

```bash
cd ~/go/src/github.com/nemonik/helloworld-web
mkdir -p tests/inspec
cd tests/inspec
inspec init profile helloworld-web
```

If asked, accept the product license by entering

```
yes
```

And the output from [InSpec](https://github.com/inspec/inspec) will resemble

```

### 12.20.2. Execute the InSpec tests on your `helloworld-web` deployment

We'll execute the [InSpec](https://github.com/inspec/inspec) test of the [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/what-is-kubernetes/) deployment

```bash
cd ~/go/src/github.com/nemonik/helloworld-web/tests/inspec/helloworld-web/
inspec exec .
```

The output will resemble

```

```

We check each resource ([Ingress](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/), [Service](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/), and [Deployment](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/)) declared in the deployment for conformance.

### 12.20.3. Add an `inspec` rule to the Makefile

Add the [InSpec](https://github.com/inspec/inspec) step to our `Makefile` with

```bash
cd ~/go/src/github.com/nemonik/helloworld-web
nvim Makefile
```

Update the `.PHONY` and `all` rule

```Makefile
.PHONY: all clean fmt lint test sonar build run docker-build docker-push deploy inspec

all: sonar deploy inspec
```

And then at the bottom add

```Makefile
inspec:
	inspec exec tests/inspec/helloworld-web/. --chef-license=accept-silent
```

Executing

```bash
make inspec
```

The results resemble

[![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/9u3BxL9kTU43vUvwdNWUk38TZ.svg)](https://asciinema.org/a/9u3BxL9kTU43vUvwdNWUk38TZ)

### 12.20.4. Add a `inspec` step to the pipeline

Now that we've preflighted our [InSpec](https://github.com/inspec/inspec) test from our host, let's add the test to our pipeline.

#### 12.20.4.1. Build, tag, and push our `inspec` step container

We'll build from the `nemonik/drone-kubectl:1.21.1` we built earlier

Let's changes directories and set up our project for this your the shell

```bash
cd $HOME/Development/workspace
mkdir drone-inspec
cd drone-inspec
git init --initial-branch=master
```

We'll create a `Dockerfile` in `nvim`

```Dockerfile
FROM k3d-registry.nemonik.com:5000/nemonik/drone-kubectl:1.21.1

LABEL maintainer "Michael Joseph Walsh <github.com@nemonik.com>"

USER root

RUN curl https://omnitruck.chef.io/install.sh | bash -s -- -P inspec

ENV PATH="/opt/sinlead/kubectl/bin:$PATH"

ENTRYPOINT ["inspec"]

CMD ["--help"]
```

The `curl https://omnitruck.chef.io/install.sh | bash -s -- -P inspec` step install Inspec as per <https://docs.chef.io/inspec/install/>.

Then build, tag and push the container into our private container registry

```bash
docker build -t nemonik/drone-inspec:latest .
docker tag nemonik/drone-inspec:latest k3d-registry.nemonik.com:5000/nemonik/drone-inspec:latest
docker push k3d-registry.nemonik.com:5000/nemonik/drone-inspec:latest
```

Output will resemble

[![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/KaEN3ttRjvtGjo5Mktfu59oOl.svg)](https://asciinema.org/a/KaEN3ttRjvtGjo5Mktfu59oOl)

#### 12.20.4.2. Add the compliance-as-code (`inspec`) step to the pipeline

Head back into our `helloworld-web` project (i.e., `~/go/src/github.com/nemonik/helloworld-web/`)

```bash
cd ~/go/src/github.com/nemonik/helloworld-web/
nvim .drone.yml
```

Add the `inspec` step at the bottom

```yaml
- name: inspec
  image: k3d-registry.nemonik.com:5000/nemonik/drone-inspec:latest
  settings:
    kubernetes_cert:
      from_secret: k8s_cert
    kubernetes_token:
      from_secret: k8s_token
  commands:
    - inspec exec tests/inspec/helloworld-web/. --chef-license=accept-silent
```

To execute your pipeline, push your changes to [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/rluna-gitlab/gitlab-ce)

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "added inspec step to pipeline"
git push origin master
```

Head over to Drone and watch the `helloworld-web` repository pipeline execute (e.g., <https://drone.nemonik.com/root/helloworld-web>).

Output of the `inspec` step of the pipeline will resemble

```
+ cd tests/inspec/helloworld-web
+ inspec exec . --chef-license=accept-silent

**NOTES**

- If your `deploy` step fails with `default: inspec - Error` you likely skipped building, tagging and pushing the `nemonik/drone-inspec:latest` container image in the prior step. You can debug by looking at the `drone-runner-kube` logs. This pod is used to run your pipelne.

  ```bash
  kubectl logs -n drone -l app.kubernetes.io/component=drone-runner-kube
  ```

  Look for something like

  ```
  time="2021-07-17T22:14:57Z" level=warning msg="Engine: Container start timeout" build.id=5 build.number=5 container=drone-lret11jqiuakvomlap51 error="kubernetes error: container failed to start in timely manner: id=drone-lret11jqiuakvomlap51" image="k3d-registry.nemonik.com:5000/nemonik/drone-inspec:latest" placeholder="drone/placeholder:1" pod=drone-3a4ux4q4mj7z29j78hbr repo.id=1 repo.name=helloworld-web repo.namespace=root stage.id=5 stage.name=default stage.number=1 step=inspec step.name=inspec thread=8
  ```

  near the end as an indication.

### 12.20.5. Viewing the `inspec` results in Heimdall 2

We'll use [Heimdall 2](https://github.com/mitre/heimdall2) to view the results in security engineer friendly manner.

```bash
cd  ~/go/src/github.com/nemonik/helloworld-web
inspec exec --chef-license=accept-silent tests/inspec/helloworld-web/. --reporter json > tests/reports/inspec_helloworld.json
```

Open [Heimdall 2](https://github.com/mitre/heimdall2) - (e.g., <http://heimdall.nemonik.com>). You will need to authenticate and will be presented with an upload pane. Make sure `LOCAL FILES`, click `Choose files to upload`, then browse to navigate to `inspec_helloworld.json` in the class project (`go/src/github.com/nemonik/helloworld-web/tests/reports/inspec_helloworld.json`) and upload to view the results.

#### 12.20.5.1. Supplemental InSpec output for viewing in Heimdall 2

The [./supplemental](./supplemental) folder holds

- [./supplemental/k3s-server-sample.json](./supplemental/k3s-server-sample.json) - a compliance scan against a K3S Cluster as per the K8s STIG.
- [./supplemental/RHEL7-STIG-scan-sample.json](./supplemental/RHEL7-STIG-scan-sample.json) - a compliance scan against a Centos7 VM as per the RHEL7 STIG.

the results of two other InSpec tests that show off the power of [Heimdall 2](https://github.com/mitre/heimdall2). Give uploading these into [Heimdall 2](https://github.com/mitre/heimdall2) a try.

**NOTES**

- As we are using the [Heimdall Enterprise Server 2 edition](https://github.com/mitre/heimdall2) we have a REST API available to upload the results from our pipeline. Maybe in a future version of my class, I'll add.

### 12.20.6. Add an automated functional test (`selenium`) step to the pipeline

Although, functional testing, where a system is tested against the functional requirements, is by far the most expensive, most brittle and arguably least valuable in comparison to integration and unit testing, it still has its place in testing an application.

In this section, we're going to write an automated functional test for `helloworld-web` application instead of relying on a manual functional test. Why? Because the automated functional test can be repeatedly and reliably executed over and over. The same can be said not be said for tests written in english to be processed and executed by humans.

We're going to write our functional tests in [Selenium](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium), a portable software-testing framework for web applications. Essentially, [Selenium](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium) automates web browsers.

More can be found here

<http://www.seleniumhq.org/>

You'll need a couple of shells open to your `development` vagrant to complete this section.

#### 12.20.6.1. Pull and run the Selenium Chrome Standalone browser

In a shell retrieve the [standalone-firefox:3.141](https://hub.docker.com/layers/selenium/standalone-firefox/3.141/images/sha256-9a199a23b054cb7dbf167507f28fe000c9e9d2d4291516edd1788572474433f3?context=explore) container, tag, and push it into our private container registry.

```bash
docker pull selenium/standalone-chrome:3.141
docker tag selenium/standalone-chrome:3.141 k3d-registry.nemonik.com:5000/selenium/standalone-chrome:3.141
docker push k3d-registry.nemonik.com:5000/selenium/standalone-chrome:3.141
```

If you're using the [fish](https://fishshell.com/) shell

```fish
set host_ip (cat /tmp/host_ip)
```

If you're using [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) or [Zsh](https://www.zsh.org/) shell

```bash
export host_ip="$(cat /tmp/host_ip)"
```

Then regardles of your shell start the [selenium/standalone-chrome:3.141](https://hub.docker.com/layers/selenium/standalone-chrome/3.141/images/sha256-bc4023992691ab8e2f20297f334fdcddd982928fbd969239b39b3dbc2dfc0657?context=explore) container

```bash
docker run --rm --shm-size=1g -p 4444:4444 --add-host helloworld.nemonik.com:$host_ip --name standalone-chrome k3d-registry.nemonik.com:5000/selenium/standalone-chrome:3.141
```

This spins up headless Chrome browser you can programmatically drive, so we can use it run our automated functional test. The container is running in the foreground so we can watch the log output.

**NOTES**

- `--add-host helloworld.nemonik.com:$host_ip` parameter is needed, because the container will not know how to resolve the `helloworld.nemonik.com` domain. This is not a problem in the cluster as [./coredns/patch.sh](./coredns/patch.sh) patches CoreDNS so that containers running inside the cluster can resolve the domain.

A good start outputs to the command line like so

```

```

Leave this shell running the container and move on...

#### 12.20.6.2. Create our functional test automation

Open another shell, so we can author and run our automated test.

In this other shell, we'll create a folder to hold our automated functional test like so

```bash
cd ~/go/src/github.com/nemonik/helloworld-web/tests/
mkdir selenium
cd selenium
```

We're going to write our test in [Python](https://www.python.org/). [Python](https://www.python.org/) is already installed on your host, but [Ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible) automation also installed [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) as well as Python 3.9.6. To check

```bash
pyenv versions
```

Output will resemble

```
  system
  3.9.5
* 3.9.6 (set by /Users/mjwalsh/.pyenv/version
```

The one marked with an Asterix (\*) is the presently configured Python

```bash
python version
```

Will verify we'll be using `Python 3.9.6` as well.

So, now that's taken care of, but we're going to use [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) to create our project, manage our dependencies and run our [Selenium](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium) test.

Perform the following

```bash
poetry new func-test-helloworld-web
cd func-test-helloworld-web
```

Output will resemble

```
Created package func_test_helloworld_web in func-test-helloworld-web
```

Indicating [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) created a `func-test-helloworld` folder under `~/go/src/github.com/nemonik/helloworld-web/tests/selenium` along with a virtualenv for the project that will resemble this folder structure

```
func-test-helloworld-web
├── README.rst
├── func_test_helloworld_web
│   └── __init__.py
├── pyproject.toml
└── tests
    ├── __init__.py
    └── test_func_test_helloworld_web.py
```

[Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) handles retreiving and adding the `selenium==3.141` dependency via

```bash
poetry add selenium==3.141
```

Output will resemble

```
Creating virtualenv functional-pSxRwJgh-py3.9 in /Users/mjwalsh/Library/Caches/pypoetry/virtualenvs

Save the file and exit. Yep. All this code to execute an automated functional test for the return of the text _Hello world!_. They're note cheap. Top of the test pyramid expensive, so use them wisely.

For now, if your using the [fish](https://fishshell.com/) shell let us run our test by entering into the command line

```fish
set -x SELENIUM_HOST localhost
set -x SELENIUM_PORT 4444
set -x HELLOWORLD_WEB_URL https://helloworld.nemonik.com
poetry run python func_test_helloworld_web/test.py -v
```

If you're using [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) or [Zsh](https://www.zsh.org/) perform the following

```bash
export SELENIUM_HOST=localhost
export SELENIUM_PORT=4444
export HELLOWORLD_WEB_URL=https://helloworld.nemonik.com
poetry run python func_test_helloworld_web/test.py -v

#### 12.20.6.3. Build, tag, and push the `selenium` step container

In your shell

First pull down, tag and push

```bash
docker pull python:3.9.6
docker tag python:3.9.6 k3d-registry.nemonik.com:5000/nemonik/python:3.9.6
docker push k3d-registry.nemonik.com:5000/nemonik/python:3.9.6
```

Then we'll need to create a container to execute our `selenium` step.

```bash
cd ~/Development/workspace/
mkdir python-poetry
cd python-poetry
git init --initial-branch=master
nvim Dockerfile
```

And copy the following into it

```
FROM k3d-registry.nemonik.com:5000/nemonik/python:3.9.6

LABEL maintainer "Michael Joseph Walsh <github.com@nemonik.com>"

RUN pip install --upgrade pip && \
    pip install poetry
```

Now to build, tag, and push the container to our private container registry

```bash
docker build -t nemonik/poetry:latest .
docker tag nemonik/poetry:latest k3d-registry.nemonik.com:5000/nemonik/poetry:latest
docker push k3d-registry.nemonik.com:5000/nemonik/poetry:latest
```

Output will resemble

```

#### 12.20.6.4. Add the `selenium` step to the pipeline

Edit the `.drone.yml` file at the root of your `helloworld-web` project and add the following `selenium` step, the `shared_memory` volume, and a `firefox` service.

```yaml
- name: selenium
  image: k3d-registry.nemonik.com:5000/nemonik/poetry:latest
  commands:
  - cd tests/selenium/func-test-helloworld-web
  - export SELENIUM_HOST=localhost
  - export SELENIUM_PORT=4444
  - export HELLOWORLD_WEB_URL=https://helloworld.nemonik.com
  - poetry install
  - poetry run python func_test_gitlab/test.py -v

services:
- name: chrome
  image: k3d-registry.nemonik.com:5000/selenium/standalone-chrome:3.141
  volumes:
  - name: shared_memory
    path: /dev/shm

volumes:
- name: docker
  host:
    path: /var/run/docker.sock
```

**NOTE**

- `services` is not part of the prior steps, because it is not a step, but enumeration of services, so be careful when you edit the pipeline. [Drone CI](https://github.com/drone/drone) uses the `services:` section to spin up a patched version of `k3d-registry.nemonik.com:5000/selenium/standalone-chrome:3.141` exposed with the name `chrome`.

But before you execute the pipeline it needs to be updates to be a trusted repository as the service will need access to `/var/run/docker.sock`.

1. Open the `helloworld-web` repository in [Drone CI](https://github.com/drone/drone) (e.g., <https://drone.nemonik.com/root/helloworld-web/settings>).
2. Under `Project Settings` toggle `Trusted` so that is enabled (i.e., blue ) to enable privileged container settings.
3. Click `SAVE CHANGES`.

Let's kick off the pipeline by committing our code

```bash
git add .drone.yaml
git commit -m "added seleniuim step"
git push origin master
```

While successful output for the `selenium` stage will resemble

```

**NOTE**

- If your build fails outright with the message `default: linter: untrusted repositories cannot mount host volumes`, you have forgotten the enable `Trusted` for the `root/hellworld-web` repository in [Drone CI](https://github.com/drone/drone). You can go back do that and restart the build by clicking on the hamburger (the icon with three dots in a vertical line) to open a drop down and selecting ``RESTART`.

## 12.21. Add the DAST (`owasp-zap`) step to the pipeline

Dynamic application security testing (DAST) is used to detect security vulnerabilities in an application while it is running, so as to help you remediate these concerns while in development. Again, yet another example of "thinking about application and infrastructure security from the start."

The OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP) is one of the world’s most popular free DAST tools actively maintained by hundreds of international volunteers, so add a step to test the application.

We'll pull the [owasp/zap2docker-stable:2.10.0](https://hub.docker.com/layers/owasp/zap2docker-stable/2.10.0/images/sha256-fa9c69ef7b4b5c6395df2fa50b40146651b87b6a0b019f97d930532bb4e79214?context=explore) container image from Docker Hub, then tag and push the container image into our private registry

```bash
docker pull owasp/zap2docker-stable:2.8.0
docker tag owasp/zap2docker-stable:latest k3d-registry.nemonik.com:5000/owasp/zap2docker-stable:2.8.0
docker push k3d-registry.nemonik.com:5000/owasp/zap2docker-stable:2.8.0
```

If you're using the [fish](https://fishshell.com/) shell

```fish
set host_ip (cat /tmp/host_ip)
```

If you're using either [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) or [Zsh](https://www.zsh.org/)

```bash
export host_ip="$(cat /tmp/host_ip)"
```

Regardless of your shell you then

```bash
 docker run --rm --add-host helloworld.nemonik.com:$host_ip k3d-registry.nemonik.com:5000/owasp/zap2docker-stable:2.8.0 zap-baseline.py -t http://helloworld.nemonik.com
```

OWASP ZAP will take some time to run as it works to find security vulnerabilities in our running application, so give it time.

When finished its output will resemble

```

Great, now lets add another step to our pipeline after the `selenium` step, but before `services:` block. Again, before the `services:` block.

```yaml
- name: owasp-zap
  image: k3d-registry.nemonik.com:5000/owasp/zap2docker-stable:2.8.0
  commands:
    - zap-baseline.py -t http://helloworld.nemonik.com || true
```

**NOTE**

- Again, add this new step right after the last `step`, but before the `services:`.

To execute your pipeline, push your changes to [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/rluna-gitlab/gitlab-ce)

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "added owasp-zap step to the pipeline"
git push origin master
```

Open your `root/helloworld-web` repository (e.g., <https://drone.nemonik.com/root/helloworld-web>) in [Drone CI](https://github.com/drone/drone) and monitor the progress of the build. The pipeline should execute in a few minutes.

Successful output for this stage resembles the prior output

# 13. Additional best practices to consider around securing containerized applications

This class doesn't cover a number of container application development best practices. A topic out of scope of the original intention of this course; especially, as I'm already cramming in several days of course material into a one-day course when taught in person, but perhaps subsequent course updates I'll cover a few of the following not already covered in the course material as additional topics. The biggest reason why relates with the following sections. Agile and DevOps both exist to deliver features into the hands of users. We're not doing DevOps to do DevOps. If all anyone talks about is DevOps in the absence of the application life cycle you have a problem. Also, DevOps is very much intertwined with modern cloud-native development.

With that, here's some best practices for containerized application development and operation:

1. Follow https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/dockerfile_best-practices/ and http://www.projectatomic.io/docs/docker-image-author-guidance/ guidance.
2. Re-use existing upstream images from trusted sources.
3. Avoid multiple processes executing in your own container images.
4. Clean temporary files, such as, OS package repository caches, when creating your images.
5. Avoid running the container’s process as root.
6. Harden your Docker configuration as per an [InSpec](https://github.com/inspec/inspec) compliance profile, such as https://github.com/mitre/docker-ce-cis-baseline and https://github.com/dev-sec/cis-docker-benchmark or if you are using another container runtime either find one for the runtime or write your own compliance profile.
7. Doing item-6 will require you to make use of a [notary](https://github.com/theupdateframework/notary) and private container registry (e.g., <https://hub.docker.com/_/registry>, <https://hub.docker.com/r/sonatype/nexus3>). I’ve written [Ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible) IaC to deploy Notary and it was a real pain in the butt to figure it out and took my countless hours, because the documentation is to put it plainly, "Sh!t." It would seem, they (i.e., whoever owns Docker Enterprise now) wants you to use Docker Enterprise vice getting Notary up and running with Docker.
8. Put your application development through a CICD pipeline like this class of the following that applies: code format enforcement, linting, static analysis, build automation, unit testing, compliance-as-code for the container image, automated functional test, and dynamic analysis.
9. Consider adding to your CICD pipelines the execution of vulnerability scanning tools, such as, [Clair](https://coreos.com/clair/docs/latest/), [Docker Bench for Security](https://github.com/docker/docker-bench-security), [OpenSCAP Workbench](https://github.com/OpenSCAP/scap-workbench/releases), [Anchore](https://anchore.com/opensource/), et cetera. There will be overlap between these and other similar tools. Pick the ones that work the best for you, ones with frequent updates and having the largest vibrant community around.

# 14. That is all

You can now uninstall the cluster and the registries.

```bash
make uninstall
make uninstall-pullthrough
make uninstall-registry
```

And this ends my class.

This is class is a labor of love (i.e., I'm not getting paid to author and maintain it).
